the ordinary people will suffer . even if it is turning over its body , the <unk> is still a <unk> <unk> , even if it is over .
if people express their views and thinking is somewhat different than the traditional <unk> then they will be called for foreign <unk> , or is accused of <unk> and fascinating foreign things , or they will be accused of both foreign things .
they are more considered a traitor in the culture of culture , <unk> with nationalism and patriotism . 
in fact , in fact , the us no longer need to use force to deal with the china , because it achieved a result to defeat its enemy with fighting . 
is the article too intense ? united states is so good ? 
if your eyes does n't have seen and your ears does n't hear what it exists , 3 people are creating a tiger . 
just past and looked at , i do n't express my opinion .
coming to study and learned .
very , very attracted .
it should <unk> be <unk> .
some people have n't forget their china . if the country needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness 
i really hate those that dogs are to those who drink the china , saying america is so whatever , but if america is so good , then go to find your father without legitimate . 
i feel that our people should have learned to dprk more , and that the <unk> of socialism needs to be held , but it is able to forget what mao zedong thinks . 
only the only thoughts of mao zedong can save the nation . 
there are too many traitors of china ! 
patriotism is the bottom line . everyone has to prove that they are <unk> in the nation .
i think there 's not that elite , some corrupt officials were <unk> .
remove this group of <unk> .
i 'm just looking .
we need the us , as so many traitors of china in the history of china . 
because of the chaos in east africa and north africa , we also have to prevent the dog runner to <unk> west imperialist imperialist america . 
everything has a sets of its number . there is no time when the weather changes change in china . they can only be able to pay as well like dogs and nothing else , they can only be disappointed . 
people come to all the china court before no long direction . the world has led to the world . this is the intended of heaven . 
following , there is in interest .
the modern china is just just in this , and we can do nothing . 
to our compatriots , too many traitors .
freedom of speech is relatively . we need to accounts about national conditions .
freedom @/@ thinking . if people express traditional views and put up with traditional views and put slightly different criticism , then they will be called for foreign ' <unk> , or has been accused of <unk> foreigners among foreign things .
i would like to ask a person who says this , she was one of those who mentioned above those above those .
according to the <unk> that it is fascinating in military affairs , the quality of the military and military clothing , who want to become soldiers ( not in various reasons ) , so we welcome to join the military fans' alliance in the <unk> @-@ <unk> groups . the military fans' alliance has to adhere to the system in the event . <unk> this group is " <unk> " and modified their group card , and that this groups will only be able to enter their own business card , and that you do n't ask you to leave please with the understanding of other people , so if you 're <unk> and not following the system you will volunteer to leave you . 
support and true .
at critical moments we all went out from the <unk> yan and huang . 
look at the kuomintang 's cooperation with the kuomintang at that year , and you know . 
<unk> creation has not been in a peaceful year in war with everybody in war .
it may compete from cultural revolution article by <unk> that the problem by <unk> the problem , to become a question of principle or ideological lines of questions . 
it is a good thing <unk> by the 5 th century for a vested interest in the communist party . 
if you want to destroy people , your national culture , with a language <unk> and write , it 's not all those who go to the next <unk> , everyone or everyone who have gone for higher schools , it must be the test to be the test to the english . 
it 's .
you 're <unk> and <unk> a <unk> ! it makes sense for opportunities .
in fact , the us has no longer need to use a force as a deal between its enemy with the china , as it has to defeat its own enemy without fighting . 
yes , there are many foreign <unk> of the foreigners . time we should <unk> .
the ruling authorities actually should be attended this kind of <unk> <unk> . once , deng xiaoping said that the communist party had n't been overthrown by the communist party , deng xiaoping said that in the speech of us , the former ambassador in us , it said that we can raise 800000 <unk> , and that the cia would then topple the 800000 - year - called " 800000 <unk> " and the cia would then use its 8000000 - year , and the citizens would definitely need to be alert to help and they want to allow the wind to make waves in domestic , and they have no need to let them use us . 
so why i 'm saying that the experts had been seen for the past several days , i 'd say that the experts will see wang jingwei 's <unk> with his <unk> . 
the west society allows these people to see that democracy is fair and justice . 
since the domestic political development is truly too slow , it can n't be avoided criticism by people with a bit advanced ideology . can we blame the others for this ?
is n't someone to say if it was <unk> ?
all people are selfish , and reality is also <unk> .
some of the zf 's propaganda activities will soon become the people view themselves on the joke . 
in this environment , what 's wrong with them a bit of a previous <unk> propaganda ?
we can n't look at the old account for the previous @-@ called war in japan . 
look at north korea , like our country in many years ago . look at their ridiculous propaganda . 
united states 's dream to occupy the whole world will never stop and is constantly planned . 
this day is a kind of feeling more intense thing this day ; america has already successfully successfully successful up the 5 th century , which is long at the long - china intellectual elite . 
these people can consider themselves from cultural celebrities or can have high authorities and important position , distribution in various in the society , and will take great pain in order to promote america values , and brainwash china people on the chinese people . 
why is this kind of <unk> more <unk> ?
so i 've read the part of specialist professor this day , so it 's not reading it , but after it 's really surprised me . 
renmin university <unk> , zhang ming , is extremely obvious , the political thing of many of his blog blog is extremely obviously . 
for example , he attributed the reasons for hostile school <unk> in china to have wang erxiao in 1 blog , and has <unk> a good article that promote them even with even half . 
another example of so called <unk> social activists are another example . first , the stuff are n't like things like haite sexology report . second , she does n't deep think . third , she has n't <unk> <unk> . 
she mainly rely on whether to do something different and <unk> <unk> in the fact that she is n't really capable or learning , but she is , she is pure clowns that she is pure behind .
this kind of people have put on big specialists , which is just <unk> to the big specialists . the key is she did n't yet understand politics , yet she was about politics , but she was a <unk> , but she is doing she to be to be " <unk> ", but she feels she felt fine for foreign and she feels she was fine .
for example , she completely <unk> a class struggle and a bit of a bit less than a bit of <unk> and illegal publications in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
she attributed to the china society by the china society on <unk> in the <unk> of the china , which has already become a country with the most of the money than earth . 
in a <unk> in the <unk> , she <unk> the student students become the terrorists , whether you study him or bill ? 
in the <unk> of the title , she took the citizens to publishing with the citizens to freedom of speech , and said the international court should be established in order to solve the problem of pornographic product and said that beijing 's driving opposition would be <unk> . 
in today , in the title , especially in today , she <unk> <unk> with several beijing city dealing with such a close attention to the jianghe business and suspected of such <unk> <unk> in the union and suspected of being involved in terms of <unk> products , and gave a <unk> intended of <unk> the <unk> of other people . 
however , it 's really preposterous that sina actually put this kind of <unk> articles on the top . 
america and the whole nations of america are clearly in front of the eyes <unk> china and the whole nations of their <unk> feel <unk> a friendly <unk> - <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " when they were not <unk> ) , who were actually going to do <unk> the spirit of china , which is also <unk> by <unk> . 
yi zhongtian , as far as his <unk> , i have always expect his actually respect by his <unk> , but i do n't expect to support mao yushi 's big traitor by saying that once again , which makes me to be a very much <unk> <unk> - once again . '' 
on the internet 100 years on the internet , i also feel that the conclusion of a complete note of " 100 social <unk> in the china celebrities of the ford foundation had accepted political <unk> , becoming a increasing <unk> and has already become similar and fear to the country . 
however , when these people frequently remarks out a traitor , i do n't understand why no one was being <unk> and , and we can continue their high position when they will call the wind and <unk> the rain in the <unk> and the public opinion .
with the <unk> of the south newspaper newspapers , i feel that intellectual elite <unk> over the short while the <unk> <unk> , i feel that it 's able to sink with media personality .
i remember us just war more than 60 years ago china and still a threat to use nuclear weapons . 
us has entered vietnam more than 40 years ago to contain china . 
it has established a relationship with china 22 years ago , but it started imposed sanctions on the past 22 years ago and <unk> the chinese embassy , 12 years ago , and <unk> a sino @-@ year ago to contain china with greater <unk> 2 years ago . 
why do n't i do n't understand what we were china to forget so ? 
why are so many who still who speak on the us ? " 
people are n't going to improve the ability to keep in a big <unk> . the china we can have the greatest weak in this . 
it must also stand to the reasons , and the rapidly run of the <unk> of china and the fifth shows will also stand to the reasons . 
the entire possible . do n't we raise the china who are traitors of the china in primary school ? 
the entire possible . do n't we raise the china who are traitors of the china in primary school ?

this is really the beginning of trouble , everyone has to spend all times to try to conduct the rules , trying to understand the rules , or fight those who did n't follow it .
that is a problem of <unk> .
the rules was removed who do not help business more competition , meaning they must race in the bottom to counter new business starting on new business .
it is like the monopoly rules will be changed for half times the game in the game , not all the previous purchase . 
that does n't benefit capitalism despite some telling you .
i would only agree with the arab who <unk> all the bomb <unk> for example . 
that i can see about humor , but that is extremely <unk> .
an report that kind of an <unk> should not have a place in college .
however , these kids have listed <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and others , and a few other nations that are not sensitive about the race .
is not the race of race ?
are they not in mexico ? 
that is a huge part of them to dress when you get far away from the cities .
how is that insulting ?
it does n't show someone who does something <unk> , but it will use the society of the society as an statement .
<unk> are not <unk> too .
again , this only has it to take it done over the board .
sometimes people seem to look for a reason for themselves .
frankly in perspective about it .
someone will always see something and wants to think the worst thing .
that does n't change with a dress or a dress with an location_1 .
and why is not only the <unk> of those the only <unk> @/@ culture ?
was it just as far as <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> your teeth , white <unk> and white <unk> ?
what about a woman who wear <unk> <unk> , high <unk> and too much make up to <unk> ?
this forever drive in which does not be found , it must stop .
and if someone wants to look at the reasons that they will be held back because they have to have whatever reason for their heads , they always find the justification .
but we have really jumped on free society , why is the board on this super <unk> behavior ?
why is it ok now to find the most small <unk> and threw out new discrimination ?
and this rule is only going to apply for 2 or 3 race ?
america , white people , blacks , the green person , short people , <unk> <unk> , <unk> people . 
what do you have a fun of all ? when it comes to an location_1 and halloween , is going to make all in some ways , but the only 3 race will get a red light ? 
is n't that racist ?
the students are <unk> bleeding , and will be temper enough enough to realize one and cultural <unk> , to realize that one should be able to laugh and obsessed with them , and this is n't the evil mechanism of racism .
this is absolutely ridiculous thread .
i mean , it is actually banned in terms of racism , if you can all have a point .
i 'm on the <unk> of the white people in us , as there was anyone <unk> about it . 
but anyone else read the article ?
no one has banned an halloween halloween . 
no one even talking about the ban of an halloween address . 
in fact , in this story , no one here wants to ban anything , they want to ban anything , apparently who want to ban the except .
these students have simply goal .
they said if we can change a few people or we can make their thoughts .
they did n't ban anything or stop anybody to do anything .
this story : the students expressed freedom speech .
they make the people who express their opinions .
of course , you want to wear an <unk> official by others , with free speech .
but it is also a free - that i complaining about your what you are an atheist .
neither should be banned .
and that 's the way of that it works .
it is not irrelevant to those in which you 're an black face and <unk> , or you are an an <unk> <unk> <unk> in a little <unk> <unk> i think .
freedom speech is free speech and that 's actually the opposite of the alleged ban .
at the end of the end , you all turned into this story .
dear massachusetts , should she have any chance of <unk> the republican party senator scott brown ? 
why need scott brown had been <unk> for scott brown ? i would kinda like him . 
can elizabeth warren beat scott brown ? 
i do n't see the girl fighting the girl is fighting a lot of them , ( i 'm not going to see , but since they were a lot of <unk> , quantity_2 <unk> <unk> , some <unk> people have to stay at the school for almost 1 weeks until the <unk> goes down her back . 
so yes , i said .
i think democratic party will get 1 more senate seat . 
it seems that it is a lot of task in massachusetts , which is a lot more than the other race with the senate . 
the best thing i think is that it is to keep a few <unk> of the republican party we have in their rights location . 
he 's reasonable one of the coming of representative of liberal <unk> <unk> , but that he could vote for most of the party <unk> .
not known , does it sounds like real <unk> ?
it makes it really great <unk> .
you care if you explain why you think that he is an idiot .
he was beaten by rather convinced martha coakley . 
he served as a state man for several years for several years . 
he even voted for several democratic party bills . 
coakley is a bad candidate running the terrible campaign , i <unk> around a great article that <unk> i read 1 years ago . 
it would be difficult for brown to answer the policy of policy for him . 
i 've seen several occasions that he is a answer to several times just <unk> <unk> that he really do n't understand the underlying issues at all .
i really do n't being active political or even care about politics until recently and i 'm just looking for things on other peoples opinions on this .
well but do n't probably be much <unk> you just told you who i would vote for you ?
what issue are the important for you ?
because i thought he did a good job for most areas , he let me down me in some areas , and i do n't vote for the republican party for today . 
i 've done in the past the few <unk> in the past .
anyone were not republican party . 
i think the majority of them would cause these countries have become <unk> for an important of everything .
they are willing to throw the america under the bus to make obama look bad . 
<unk> - a lot , and you add a lot !
i would have voted for obama because i thought he did a good job in terms circumstances , and i can do much more in another terms , and i am really worried about what if any of the 1 nominee of the republican party would win , if 1 of them won . 
i 've also heard some good thing about ron paul , but i do n't also vote just any republican party ( rick perry ) , he 's the only one who was actually more interested in this . 
in my opinion , ron paul is happy , especially my race and especially debate . 
i would like how he is as opposed to the war and anti @-@ bullshit .
however , i do n't absolutely want he was a president .
andrew sullivan has a lot of post on him which could be a good place to start if you 're interested more to learn . 
he <unk> with ron paul here , he endorsed him and then the second thought . 
i read a <unk> piece on wsj today . 
the author spoke on how of obama 's approval rating . 
it appears that he can n't pull the congress together to accomplish much , and the author is only getting worse if he was elected to the second term . 
he would like obama <unk> the second term and hillary clinton was running for president . 
he believed that hillary is the best chance to bring the country together . 
i do n't know what she feels on run but i think it 's a great idea and i think it is .
certainly , she has <unk> and experience and have been approved by a majority of citizens .
i think people in the republican party side for a <unk> , i 'm a poor bunch . 
one of the <unk> of the america die were not one of the <unk> . 
imo and a independent person who decides to have this election is in my opinion . they certainly vote for any anti @-@ life <unk> of <unk> <unk> . 
what do you think ?
should obama step down the country 's good ? 
should hillary run ? 
hillary 's time came and gone . 
she is not friends with the democratic party with doing it and losing the vote of blacks . 
no one has voted for mr. obama who did n't vote for mr. obama and a whole lot of less voted for her . 
do n't worry , though .
she made enough enough to her if she did n't try to run for a great president out of her party .
according to the best case obama is re @-@ term and that the country continues to slide backwards even if the democratic party gain the greater ambitions of us senate and increased their collective mass mass in the congress congress . 
with the worst case , the elections is the relationship for george w. bush ii , not meant to huntsman , romney or ron paul or romney . 
so that means that the republican party is likely to gain further by the congress , and even perhaps gain by the senate . 
then the country would slide back in the <unk> recession .
i suspect you are wrong that the moderate people are inclined to vote and especially one that you call to the tea bag is inclined to vote .
i can n't think you 're wrong , but i think you 're wrong turned out about <unk> <unk> <unk>
i expected to be fairly good turns out of that group for that groups are anti @-@ obama . 
i can accept hillary . 
i was not a great impressed by the republican party fields , like it was n't impressed by phoenix . 
the <unk> candidate of the democratic party are not crazy either . 
but obama seems to be even less likely to give up cain up . 
i guess i 'm not <unk> about the future of the country 's future in the next 5 years .

jcboy , do they actually actually vote for gay marriage yet ? 
i got a mixed message for ny times .

look at massachusetts . they have had it since 2004 . 
do you hear their society is falling , of course , not ?
i think it is rapidly spread across the country with ny and then ca . 
you can n't stop this training !

anybody know that there is a legal way to teach the man 's teaching lessons of the men ?
it is to filed a police report to the police ?

why can you not ensure that you are really upset and do n't want them ever to hit their kid again ?
2 of the law is 2 . 
the money damaged and jail times .
i suppose you can add a <unk> , just a replacement of jail times .
if you go through the legal routes , then it does n't end a friendship , but it 's not a matter of <unk> .
i 'm not worried about how it will end up if i am angry enough to start down this path .
i probably express what i feel about the situation and i make it clear that it has to happen again .
my son is on my son .
that 's a ex @-@ friend behavior of your ex 's behaviour .
he does n't hurt your children physically , so for the more form of the more form , the assaults are seen more serious .
you can certainly filed a report on the police .
i do n't know the laws on your things , but here is quite likely that the police can go around , question that you can decide , and make clear clear that the men are not to control the charge if you have <unk> is accurate if you are accurate .
depending on what you live in the children , you can n't believe the <unk> protection of children ,
they simply handed it on the police because it 's a extra <unk> and you already decided not to go him to his children again .
however , you 're released legal <unk> in <unk> , if you lost control of what you do .
for example , your son and your son needs a formal statement .
the police can act even even if you do n't want it .
it might go to court .
personally , i personally do n't choose to do it at that way , although you certainly can make up to local police without name the name and see such things like your area , or whether you 're such a formal <unk> , whether you 're in your area ) .
i hope that a big thing of him is that you 're a big talks and the loss of friendship .
however , i 'm concerned about his treatment of his kids .
well that was one <unk> .
if you have the evidence is the evidence of the child , i consider it 's protected for him to assaulting his kids .
was your kids ok ?
that 's scary .
did he have a nightmare or anything ?
also , my behavior is also chat with him .
it did n't warrant such reaction , but he does n't think .
if your friend is n't really unusual , i 'm gonna just worried about her too .
25 've been a woman 25 and have a 37 @-@ year @-@ old relationship with a other @-@ year @-@ old man . 
he had 2 kids including his own more kids , 1 kids from his previous relationship . 
he has been planning to divorce since the first day we met .
things are so <unk> between us and i do n't know what to do .
he 's planning to move out of the house by the end of the year because his wife and his wife did n't see eye to the eye .
he made sexual sex with a lady from sweden which he met in facebook . 
when it found out , it would be really a really bad effect .
i feel a traitor i still feel it and i can n't trust him .
how do i let go ?
jeje , you are just going away . 
do you really think so little that you believe that this is best to do .
it 's just going to be ahead of the divorce if it 's now and at least it really love you out and move out of his house .
when a man had a relationship with you , who was involved with you on the " other " up ."
when you <unk> up with a married man , you are exactly going to do what you get .
i 've made you a little time or i did n't offer you .
but you can do you a good world just to walk away from him .
then , why do n't you think you 're looking for someone not to look <unk> .
my opinion is a bit better to find a happiness if you are going to find that routes , then it 's a bit better .
