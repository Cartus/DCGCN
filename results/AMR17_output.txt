support the thread who started the thread . i reply to composed the poem .
guess your death in order to defend diaoyu islands and the relation of diaoyu islands @-@ related . 
the <unk> boat a while was <unk> . evil little <unk> stirred up trouble and unrest , with <unk> and <unk> forms , they are showing their <unk> appearance again . 
do n't ever go back to that time when we did when we signed the treaty when we 've signed the treaty , china 's strength . the sword was sharp and the knife <unk> up the approach enemy . 
2010 @-@ 9 @-@ 11 
i agree with the analysis of the thread who started a thread . in the point of the war , if the war really comes to our home , i 'd like to protect our home and defending our homeland , to spread our china 's own national dignity , and i pledged to fight our death for defense of our national dignity . 
i very much wish that during those <unk> mao zedong long march long march , i am born to lose my head , shed my blood , and spreading all our enemy wrong , and spreading our <unk> <unk> . 
how long will we be tolerated japan ? 
i get my fellow citizen .
hello everyone , yet we all know september 18th , yet again , japan plans for another sea incident like another lugou bridge ( lugou bridge ) . 
japan defied strong condemnation of the whole world , and has openly invaded the sacred territory of our country ( diaoyu islands ) . 
as we all know , diaoyu islands has always belong to china . in the historical reason , the reason that original belongs to us has become a controversy . 
my fellow citizen is our thing , and why needs negotiations , why is that japan goes even further . so can we allow to create the facts of occupied ? 
from my fellow citizen , the japan 's <unk> bring a grave disaster to asia . 
especially china has suffered japan 's <unk> for several decades . 
in northeast , the japan unit 3 is partially experiments with china living methods with extremely brutal methods , korea live , and other countries in the northeast , adding to the ancient blood layers to the ancient capital . nanjing massacre has never been <unk> away from the capital . the bloody battle in hengyang and changsha <unk> over 1000 kilometers ( <unk> miles ) and kill everything out of everything . 
my fellow citizen is that it is too many instances of the crimes committed by japan in china , which is a difficult record on all the <unk> of bamboo <unk> , which is a difficult record for all of them . 
just like that 10000000 monetary soul who lost their lives will wander over pacific ocean and found it difficult for peace . 
still , all those experience in that era is still remember by all of that era . when we turn into this history page and read the <unk> down in our cheek , even our younger generation has also cry of a tear , and our blood <unk> <unk> .
now that japan actually wants to reverse the verdict of the history of its aggression is now that they wake up fellow citizens and china in asia . 
we have to go face face with this 100 years but rather though we 're pain over our shame . we do n't create history and choose for the history of the history of history . 
it 's not why we fear . however , the territories are related to the matter of dignity . the interests of countries are small , regardless of how to change the wind and national charities , no matter our native land is <unk> , we can n't let our own land is separated by <unk> .
my fellow citizen is the <unk> of the 21 st century , it means that when the difficulties was <unk> inside and we are press from outside , and we face many challenge . 
what way should we go to the taiwan issue , the tibet issue , south china sea issue , surrounding environment or foreign forces to china . 
what do get done , please , please look at the world map , and the step of shaped @-@ <unk> is suppress our breath , <unk> our development , <unk> our national territories .
we do n't want to make our enemy , but we never afraid of the war , but we are n't afraid of war .
we must take arms and strengthen the arms and strengthen all military forces in land , sea and air .
china nation has been <unk> several times before the china nations have never had an ambition to expand their territory to an <unk> before . 
we are following a strategic security philosophy that apply to the <unk> and virtue we do n't impose what we do n't want to .
the country 's and <unk> is similar to the individuals and <unk> of the country , but we would have to insist that we do n't hurt other people , but we would have to insist that we get hurt other people .
the immigration is certainly not fear and the sincerity does n't have to be a subject .
china <unk> japan as well as the world war ii @-@ caused by world war ii @-@ caused by the world war ii . 
my fellow citizen is that people's heroes monument is a <unk> history of the china nations that would strive to be an continued improvement . 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> represented sacred @-@ peaceful expectations .
occasionally , my memory string of my memory is <unk> by <unk> up many entire <unk> <unk> and armored horses in my mind .
my thoughts will go through that historic page just as i see that famous kangxi 's generation and ruling kangxi , and also , even u.s. in his audience , and thinking about how he achieved the <unk> of great <unk> , and the former u.s. president , who has turned him unification on the territory of union . 
it is certainly dangerous in the world , so it is certainly dangerous to forget about war . my fellow citizens , we have to do n't exercise <unk> by blind and peace , but in modern , we want china being poor and <unk> , the fall behind china is a poor , and the fall behind the nation . 
where would the peace come if it 's not strong ?
we have to focus on the education of national defense , build a great wall at the hearts of 1300000000 people , and establish a full @-@ range system system that is capable of attacking and defense and defense systems . 
the best attack is the most attack . we should strengthen a force that could engage in our air @-@ range attacks , and improve great deep distance capability in order , increase a great @-@ deep combat industry and construction of the defense industry in order to avoid the influence of national economic development , and <unk> the modernization of military equipment and <unk> high @-@ high high quality divisions , and establish the elite high @-@ tech divisions .
the battle <unk> are about to sound , people are already fully equipped and ready to go .
we accomplished nothing without people to support us , but we are all powerful with supporting us .
time we said no other people , my fellow citizen , so we have to achieve .
1 . establish the guaranteed funds , the work environment and work mechanism , and hundreds of hundreds of information technology <unk> from united states and around the world will be recruited back to china . 
2 ) create a few battle groups of aircraft power carriers are created .
3 . manufacturing , various kinds of advanced combat aircraft were manufactured . 
4 . the research and deployment of a high @-@ speed ballistic missile that could be broke to more than 10000 new miles ) is <unk> . 
5 ) a nuclear experiments resume and the establishment of military forces in space .
6 ) to retain 1000 nuclear bombs equally as 10000000 tons of tnt and middle @-@ range missiles were installed in all of its short @-@ range missiles and the middle @-@ range missiles . 
7 ) to retain 30 strategic nuclear submarines , that it can inflict 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy . 
( 8 ) is abandoned your commitment to first not use nuclear weapons .
9 ) retain the right to <unk> strike as a threat to national security .
only my fellow citizen , if we are confident and improve us , we can strive to our strength , qin shi huang unification . qin shi huang has recovered taiwan , we have been responsible to carry on the far seen of our <unk> , <unk> and strong will we have to carry on our <unk> . 
now that piece of that piece of the land was <unk> far from the motherland is <unk> , <unk> and calls , we 'll carry forward a <unk> general wish , by a fellow citizen , we 'll carry forward a non @-@ <unk> wish .
when i read history , the <unk> and anger in my heart was <unk> into a nation concerns . i am willing to serve our country to voluntarily serve our country to a cloth <unk> and one of the common people , but i am not <unk> to show my sincere heart to heaven even if i died .
here , i composed the poem , with ci (poetry) , a ci (poetry) form of my heart , to voice my heart 's aspiration . 
paint the deep red <unk> .
protect diaoyu islands . 
we are <unk> our ryukyu islands bitter . 
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall for other countries ? 
100 years of <unk> 
smoking and cloud are chased by smoke waves .
the younger brother was still a youth , the youngest was still a youth .
in all direction , the seals was born .
the flag is looking at .
we <unk> our own weapons and cross into east .
let the horse drink from pacific ocean .

why do n't we fight a little japan ? 
what are still going to be tolerated ? 
they even ride our head .
do this still do this ? 
we should tell the whole world that others can n't be bullied china at the time . 
time when we showed our strength . china is too long calm . 
all the life of our citizens are currently too <unk> . the officials are too <unk> .
we already have no <unk> now . the china needs to start war . there is the harsh slap for the face of united states following united states 's rear . 
let them know that us is <unk> . if we win , if we were win , it might increase the influence of china . and if we lose , we could have increased the <unk> and make the new blood and make the <unk> get out and to update it up , let the china get it up . 
go china ! !! 
i suggest that china has strengthened china 's time to diaoyu islands , guarded the 1 1 day , protect the fish and sovereignty of our country if japan dares to invade our territory with military force , regardless of the cost we will fight a small scale war of defense . china can not lose . 
in life we need a show in life , but it 's really p. to show you by someone embrace .
i 'm just past .
the whole society including the star is like this .
damn <unk> !
it is totally unacceptable .
it is agreed to be just a cheap <unk> . they are somewhat made sense in china <unk> china . 
their living is looking by their living .
a group of 9 <unk> 
hard to life .
shocking .....
that 's normal . and a <unk> is always heartless and the <unk> are not <unk> .
they want money but do n't want face .
look at the wolf near ms. fan , you know that the acting people had to drink with him so they are not forced out or even in the frame . 
<unk>
okay as long as something <unk> eat .
no one is easy like a show . you have to look at the script to know how to the performance .
somebody is all .
people on all 360 life walking like imperial examination , so that is so the effort and <unk> behind people behind the top imperial examination . this is the fact behind the <unk> <unk> word . 
haha .
overdo .
reality .
shoot that hooligans .
cheap <unk> .
cheap <unk> .
next circles are being dirty , all men on it is a bird , the <unk> and scum .
they are pity but blame ? that 's not going to be easy .
everybody is doing this , how can you make it money if you do n't .
women pride when she was in front of other people , but when she stay alone she was a <unk> general .
nowadays , with the ancient time , the stars who are plain put are just a popular popular person , they are just people who are <unk> with some high officials and even sleeping with them , they should just be normal , so they are now a famous and even sleeping with them .
stop talking about others , just behavior .
what should we be done in the future . the ability alone is n't enough for success , do we face such a hard choices ?
more suffering are <unk> disguised as looking for some .
it 's not so bad because they are just playing out of mind in their circles .
but the old zhang jizhong who behavior in his circle in his circles , also thinking that it was not <unk> , he made tv series to wrecked the people of the whole country , when they have nothing to do . 
both take what they need .
when can china have a " pure " girl ? " 
now the story is that the story is very shocking in the next world . it is rumors that hsu yuki was forced out because he refuses to drink a lawyer with a lawyer with a family and has to switch to work instead of making the end of the end . 
each much envy star often encountered social and circumstances that they are not welcome to join but have to join it .
after all they can n't decide many things , so they must have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people .
sometimes , the very normal dinner parties who seemingly seem to us is n't that simple for the stars , like our ordinary people .
the star has a lot of contracts and if they tackle well well , if she <unk> well well , if she did n't .
the <unk> <unk> female is 2 kinds of . the first kind of those people always hold very high integrity , and also rejected all such invited . 
the second kind of people are good to play the trick and achieve their objective without their seeds .
it 's rumors that even some super super female wins his first role in this way .
after drinking some alcohol or the <unk> sponsors , they can have a chance of lying to be lied about the shoulders , feeling his chin , or kissing his cheek , and he <unk> the <unk> attitude .
they are the very 9 lower <unk> . 
those <unk> just pretend , and they are actually living a much better better life than this .
it is agreed to be just a cheap <unk> . they are somewhat made sense in china <unk> china . 
agreed .
oh gosh , there is no easy to the actors .
they deserve it . they asked for that .
there 's nothing to be easy to me .
women are a <unk> and <unk> , the man is worse than it .
smart @-@ arse .
smart @-@ arse .
it takes no longer .
in late 2004 the route 8 @-@ operation route 8 was opening around around the southwest <unk> of richmond new urban region . 
it 's already going to change the development pattern because it gets worse and cause traffic around its exit <unk> <unk> .
richmond times-dispatch told the <unk> about the impact on huguenot trail , powhatan county . 
will jones reported that traffic in the 1 section of huguenot trail has been more than doubled since the 8 opens . 
the speed and accident is surge as well .
so far this year , the quantity_0 accident was reported near the intersection of winterfield road and up the quantity_1 accident in all 2004 . 
resident engineer of the virginia department of transportation dale totten noted that if they had more money in the cost of about 13000000 dollars 4 than about the road . 
of course , vdot does not have money to construct roads in the richmond region . 
because given the local politicians and <unk> , vdot spent all of their <unk> money on 8 . 
where did homer simpson be when you need him ? 
this is a major moment , a major moment .
in our prediction , route 8 generated electricity development development in a scarce population area that <unk> over the local country and all around its exit . 
other people choose their work and where they live , but a limited accessible highways can be relieved the trafficking from people who drove back and forth . 
and they create traffic <unk> in a new place .
i am surprised that this is the only rapidly .
even , i think it might be a lagging 3 or 4 years . 
think of the information that route 8 has created the road construction for $ 13000000 in just this exit , because route 8 already created the road of the road on all of these exit . 
another prediction .
after a few more years and the approval of a mega @-@ commercial projects in the intersection of the major road , the need for new roads is soaring for a new improvement of roads . 
well , before the end of decades , we can see that the <unk> liability will get down well to the well past 400000000 dollars , which took the original highway to build the original highways . 
route 8 is such a great idea , <unk> who thinks it is . 
thanks for nothing .
i think we could spend $ 400000000 elsewhere , better . 
i think you should n't blame 8 for creating those people . 
if they were enough to create new <unk> in a new place , what would be an alternative ?
additionally , the trafficking was <unk> in old places ?
now you understand the feelings of people like tmt in fairfax . 
i usually take a position in favor of the road .
but 8 is definitely excess with <unk> needs in other parts of state . 
richmond has virtually no traffic . 
rush hours lasted 30 minutes . 
and you give them a <unk> through a largely rural area .
the road is nowhere .
just think this money can be spent on another potomac cross @-@ potomac facility or an desperate needed in nova . 
insults virginia centrist , the rest of the state 's paying for 8 during the budget deal last year , so the rest of the state will wipe out the debt , adding them from injuries . 
it 's very nice if we are obliged .
not much sense though .
it 's the same old problem with it .
if you get ahead of need , you are accused of causing <unk> .
if you built in a place where there is already an acute needs , you will claim you can n't <unk> your way out of the <unk> .
anonymous 
that is a fair point .
 made a good point . 
however , this situation <unk> to home that the state 's " audit " report was valid to find the funds of the ctb and the vdot , which is based on the best lobbyists , rather than based on the comprehensive plans for the state transportation to state . 
i have submitted this a disgrace situation that should not be tolerated .
and senator chichester and his <unk> poured more money into these flawed institutions , so this is going to get worse . 
what is the point for transportation expenses ?
in virginia it is for the benefit of private business planning and not for the service of public interests . 
you are <unk> wrong .
not less walter stoch stated that it was intended to pay the money for economic development for 8 . 
come on folks .
i do n't understand your point , tmt . 
when the last , when you do n't , or from some sort of businesses , you stick into traffic ?
it seems to me the whole road of the road is to facilitate public interests in the way of private businesses and get from the private business .
the business support is overwhelmingly necessary even though the drive was a sunday , a soccer game , of course , and a soccer game .
there is no wonder that we suffer the <unk> problems , because our roads are not match with businesses or domestic state products .
if we recognize the primary benefit of business , we should do 2 things . 
pay for our more transportation bills , of course , let 's incentive for them to locate them , even if it means in the least stressful in the system , more than more travel .
why is it so hard to understand it ?
it is a solution to a functioning pattern of human settlement and balanced the capacity of transportation systems that use of land use will generate .
<unk> else is a spin .
emr 
tmt said in virginia that it is for the benefit of private business planning and not for the service of public interests . 
i do n't see this statement point , as it appears to demonize private business plan and put public interests above all else .
i think they are <unk> <unk> , so they are virtually the same .
the local problem is obvious because these cookies are <unk> .
however , if we are <unk> business enough we eventually find us all work in the devil .
i do n't see the purpose of claims to be a solution to balance the dynamic nature that ever changed .
even you see dulles rail positive because it 's a job center that promotes <unk> and <unk> rail demand . 
i agree .
in fact , that could be enough to build it all on their own .
all i said , the exact same logic should apply to the road .
so we should have a must have a must use both end in both the end .
we need more places to get more closer to the balance we say we need to need .
check here : reality
i drove past the morning every morning and evening . 
i have <unk> up to the huguenot trail back and forth from where i work . 
i never saw anything remotely like flood of trafficking .
it has been a 55 @-@ <unk> zone for 75 @-@ 100 car . 
the huguenot trail will already planned because the development in the chesterfield side is heavily demanding , new school , a whole bunch of developing existing things that have been <unk> through robious road over the last 1 . 
8 is wonderful of those of us who actually use it , rather than the lack of the road between powhatan and the west of chesterfield . 
we can be developed commercial , and we can work closer to our life .
you can think that is the irrational use of land .
i have no desire to live in any city .
i refuse to work in the downtown area .
i refuse to use a mass transit that is not safety by <unk> female working in long hours .
and i happen to like the development of a large lot .
i do n't understand exactly how i 'm supposed to keep horse at a 1/4 acre lot . 
1 gallon of the gases could go $ 10 . 
and i still pay for life in the country .
many people prefer horses , hunting , <unk> and certain types of small businesses and make them not wanting to live in urban core .
i 'm truly baffled by this <unk> of life in the city .
if you wish to live in the country , anonymous  , you have every right to live . 
but you 're not right that the rest of the states <unk> the construction of 400000000 $ 400000000 in which is easier to work and get work . 
in a debate on the 8 debate , the else that could spend $ 400000000 , is consistently <unk> . 
if money applied to other press and even road projects , or even the road projects , the much <unk> <unk> can be <unk> .
ray hyde , my comments were directed to investors who lobby the place of roads to near property owners and the <unk> system that funds this requests , regardless or lack of links with a master transportation plan . 
i 'm 24 , and i 'm a mother of a 2.5 year mother . 
i was broken up with my son since 8 
i want to start dating the other people and my father said he had nothing to do with .
he was very <unk> and very <unk> , but he 's not right because we 're together .
it goes on too much in his life right now , and even if i told him several times and love me , he thinks we could work and love me .
i want him there with his son , without need to me , too .
but he has no no one . his family did n't get along with him and he and him had an issue .
i do n't want to be anymore anymore and would be more miserable if he was around longer .
i do n't want him for his sons because he 's a good father or at least trying him .
i believe every child will need both parents , even though they together or they are not together .
but he thought no one can have me if he could have me .
what do i do to move in my life ?
it 's very bad to be a threat to you by your ex @-@ son using your son .
you have to do n't give into that , so if you gave it back to it , it 's just <unk> .
you 're right to live your life and happy , so you have n't <unk> for his threat .
regardless of the real love him , he saw him if he really loves his son , but this is just a typical control method using such .
other people say things like i would kill me if you 're leaving me , does it get through you ?
you 're a date .
meet all kinds of people .
do what you want .
if he had a price to walk out of your life , you probably will be better off if you do n't have him .
i agree , there 's 1 other thing that your business or date is n't your business . 
i did n't tell him .
not because he 's a threat , but because he 's not about your personal life .
can you document his threat ?
you really need .
quit taking his calls and make him leave the voice mail .
make him email or his text for you .
keep that record .
get a lawyer and divorce .
if you can n't afford one , try legal aid .
tell your ex @-@ off , all communication needed to go through a lawyer .
the bus driver , people till those who deliver your food wants exactly change .
do n't they realise that you do n't get a change <unk> from the bank ?
someone must take the notes somewhere ?
people get lazy .
i would like to be near as possible as i do n't like to count the copper all day .
if you take 20 pounds of <unk> at bus , they just told you that you get from the bus because they were hell lazy . 
it 's illegal to pay certain amounts of a coin like you can only pay something like 30 <unk> 1 <unk> . 
hello , i 'll start at uni in 9 , but i am obviously not immediately <unk> with most people like most . 
however , as always , i know that i 'm taking some time to open me , i know it was very similar , <unk> , especially all the rest , and all of the rest .
all of my <unk> and i went out at night when i was here , and that 's harder for what i have ever to do .
when i <unk> , i went to my student union bar on my own .
but more point , facts are here .
i do n't enjoy uni after i was here for about 5 months . by course , the course is disillusioned , i do n't enjoy a set project and did n't like that the course was delivered . 
the university makes out that it is much better than it seems .
i 've been starting to start the first term . the financing of students would be delayed adding to the level of my stress and i am so worried that all the <unk> is unable to be progress , so it is impossible to be able to work .
a counsellor was assigned to me at uni , and i saw them in a block session for about 5 @-@ 6 weeks and if i would never really open out it because i 'm not really open out . 
only half a heart .
i am now load of my neck , i have to hit a major deadline , i 'm depressed , and anxiety is a result of feeling <unk> all the time .
i no longer have a counsellor because you can only have it in so many session at a time , and i doubt that would help me much this time if that 's already help me .
i lack the <unk> , i do n't feel comfortable with my seller , i felt i want to give to give me , but i can n't bring my give up because i end up the death end of the death and aspire to someone .
i 'd rather die to death and not living life i want to live and get worse out of the university , and i get out the matter .
i 'm 21 and turned up to 22 this year , i have no much time to fail to fail and have something to do something . 
i have failed to college once and do another course to be able to get at uni so i do n't want to go through the system over and a consistent failure .
please can someone advise me some ?
maybe go and see your doctor and see if you can get to extend your <unk> to try a bit of the pressure .
send an email like this post and they consider an mitigate circumstances , do n't worry because they see all of the university and some more comfortable <unk> , i know , because they were used to work at some of the university administration administration .
break your work on the chunk you can manage .
be concentrate on the 1 bit of work at a time , which is the most urgent assignment in the first way . 
do n't go up with your <unk> and do well do it because you try new from the very beginning .
i recommend you go to see your doctor too .
you can benefit to someone if you are always a <unk> , my friend gets a post because of anxiety , so it 's really normal , so it is really normal . 
and try to get the <unk> extension · i 'm sure your university will allow it , if you are being honest .
it got hard to keep strong and keep a living on life .
my mum divorced her , she had horrible time with my step , and she found the new freedom she will send her to round over the <unk> .
she was <unk> and <unk> with a huge angry problem with a angry problem .
she was constantly horrible for me .
when i was home i can n't cope with her <unk> and nasty remarks she was .
at my heart point , i 'm a 18 @-@ year @-@ old person with 95 % of <unk> students in a 6 rd form of a high @-@ pressure school in the sixth form . 
i can n't work at home , because she shouts at me .
so then i 'm angry with my teacher .
she was lovely at one minute like i have back , and then turned on the most competent humans in the next minute .
i 'm not going to pass my a2 and i have already accepted a defeat and that this year of life would make me failures . 
who can be able to come back about this . the university is the best offer to me , but i can n't even accept that . i have n't ever made a grades .
i wish i could have out her out of my life - things are so much better without her .
but then i think i 'm just selfish .
but surely it does n't mean that my life is like this , sure ?
it should be so much better .
but i do n't feel like i do n't control this spiral to the tax .
and i do n't know what to do .
thank you for reading .
nice <unk> !
you can n't get her as a section of that .
she even has a history of mental illness or diagnosis ?
sure , you do n't know if you do n't get a good grades so you accept the place if they can .
life threw things for you all the time .
not someone if your family is n't someone in your family .
i have to deal with a verbal abuse of 8 years before i came to uni before i came to university , and honestly , the only reason i 'm only a way out . 
if you really want out , do you work hard .
really sounds like you need to be supported somewhere else if she can consistently give yourself .
can you call childline or something like them ? 
you can go to the library on saturday and study on a good 8 hours . 
can you go to your friends 's house to form the student groups ?
you want her section because it 's a bit pain in hand and blame it for all your problems ?
i know what you feel .
my mum was <unk> in hell too .
i highly should be taken up smoke .
oh , tsr grew up and stop <unk> . it 's a joke 
i think i 've become a much weaker person in the past 1 @-@ 2 years and in the way i have <unk> down my personality down to try friends with some people in university . 
but it 's over nice people to lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever hell they want to me .
they are showing absolutely no respect .
for example , i said hello from uni and ignore me , but later 30 minute decided you want to help them some work and give them . 
it caused a lot of anger in my life and distressed in my life , and it really started to affect my concentration in uni .
does anyone get any experience to handle this sort of thing or how to go to some respect again ?
you just said no.
if you are n't particularly comfortable , you will gradually do it .
you can start sorry but i am not busy .
of course you do n't go to the top over it to go to a complete opposite direction .
if you think no , you 'd say it , you mind .
when they start to realize that you do n't bend over with them , they started more respect for you .
well this is such a bad attitude , of course , if you 're nice , but if you 're nice , you can n't be respected if you just let them do anything , but that 's not nice , but that 's a fool .
i do n't know if anyone read this , but i just feel desperate and feel i need to tell someone .
i 've left home in 9 and i started at uni in 9 . i am incredibly <unk> to do this , but i am here to think of it until getting here , i 'm here for over 2 weeks and i 'm feeling about it all of it and i feel i 'm not intelligent and social awkward . 
i had an emotional struggle for the majority since i had moved to secondary school since i had lost my dad around 9 and i always blame it for my feelings , and from 12 2009 , and this year around 3 , i 've had 2 counselling to my life in roughly 15 months . 
at the moment , i feel like the way of my life problems , and make me never more doubt my self @-@ self @-@ self @-@ self doubt , i can n't tell the work , i often find me to become very quiet at society occasions , and i often find myself , and i doubt anything about anything and everything .
2 counselling have not been diagnosed by 2 and i suggest to me that i 'm not suffering to me , but i 'm a huge worried about it as a feeling caused my dad 's suicide . 
i 've been trying to solve my problems before , and i find the exercise and <unk> in particular , also trying things like me , but i 'm also trying to me , but this is what i 'm feeling that i 'm living with self @-@ help books and <unk> tape , i wasted my chances of existence and my chance of young men being beaten away at me .
i simply do n't know what i did , and my friend ever did not <unk> what i was doing , often said i was lazy , and i can n't disagree at a lot of times , and i 'm able to disagree with like people try everything anyone can do to help , and i have failed to be a time again and time .
i 'm sorry for anyone who read this <unk> mess , i felt a bit like a <unk> who is self @-@ sought , but i truly feel desperate .
it is common that when people are in the new situation and felt the pressure to his <unk> with strangers and fit to the new role like the student students , people have become more intense .
i 'm not the health professional , and i can only speak from my personal experience , so i strongly suggest you see you qualified health professionals about what you feel about the depression and worrying about yourself .
as to the point of the first time to the university 's first time , most people feel that it was to be intelligent and the fact that it 's a lot of being a lot of , but the fact that it is to be a lot of , but the fact that it is to be a lot of , but the fact that it is to be a lot of , but the fact that it is , to the point of being a " and " to the point of that , that the fact is that it is , to the point of that , to the point of that , to the point of that , it was , to the point of that , to the point of that , it was , to the point of that , to the point of that , it was , to the point of that , it was , to the point of that , it was , to the point of that , it was , to the point of that , it was , to the point of that , it is , to the point of that it is to the point of that it is to the point of that it is to the point of that it is to the point of disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease
good luck .
i think a lot of people feel the same way you feel but they 're feeling by using your friends by using your friends , but when you are depressed you are probably not a solution as such as you are alone , but either way , you feel free for your private message .
if you were you , i 'd be on <unk> . you aspire to someone like someone who comes to bad background , happy , having a family , having family , marriage etc , you do n't want them , but you have <unk> with someone .
focus on what you achieved in life . you do n't state what you study or indeed . because you want your experience ? because you want to go ? because your mum wants you a degree for the career you want ?
either way , you 're up why you 're there and work off your bottom off to get your best grades , as you get your degree , when you get your degree and it 's hard working and passing , i have something to say .
<unk>
i hope this helps .
i 'm not pretty <unk> , i 'm not being diagnosed with <unk> but i thought doctors <unk> on my toes , but i 'm walking on my toes .
i am more comfortable with it .
what makes them decide to sign the <unk> , which seems so random and have n't always indicated .
well , i can have a signs of something in the <unk> spectrum , but who does n't have 1 or 2 . 
you guys know what i mean .
walking on the toes may be a improvement symptoms of the toes .
the trafficking may be a brain multi @-@ <unk> symptoms .
the feeling of a lot and tired of <unk> can be symptoms .
the symptoms will always apply , but if symptoms in this instance clearly caused in a lot of cases clearly , there will be worth noted that would never be diagnosed with nothing note .
i walked on my toes , but because i was born with strange toes 2 years ago that must get surgery under the time 2 years ago . 
my brother is a <unk> but i do n't notice it either , but the spectrum is so broad , and i probably had the <unk> asperger's , so i have a problem with a social reaction @/@ body language <unk> . 
but then , i do n't have a proper diagnosis , and you even have some symptoms , which can n't mean you have certain conditions .
1 was told for my toes for my toes , so i walked not to walk on my toes . 
i have <unk> .
so you can be <unk> or have a short <unk> .
it 's drill to it with people who do the dance , <unk> , <unk> , etc. i find it more comfortable now .
i have n't read too much for random symptoms like that .
hello . i 'm a 12 year old girl who was 2 harm to self @-@ 13 day , 2 year ago . 
when i was 7 , i started to slit each individual finger on <unk> and will never stop from that day . 
it 's gonna get worse because i have my legs <unk> in <unk> with <unk> in the name of my boyfriend because if i did n't stop the cut , i do n't stop my legs .
i have several <unk> in my arm .
<unk> them , then then i 'll cut me for the <unk> and <unk> .
i took around the <unk> and other drugs with <unk> and the other , and when the cuts can n't be found , i 'd take around and other drugs .
when i write this , i 'm really <unk> to cut my arms or burn .
i was <unk> - i 'll cut again when one was <unk> .
1 think it every day . 
i 'm 12 , and i 'm already sick of my life . 
this is a source that my dad left when i was 7 and she does n't want to know anymore . 
he just cared about his new girl , his wife , his new life where i do n't want to .
when i was 10 , my best mate died . 
i have a relationship with a 16 year old boy and my speech was forbidden because of events and age different . 
my mum also suffers to bipolar , and i have a depression . 
i do n't want to stop .
i do n't care what to do , i want to do it again , to torture myself , i hate me .
but i love my best mate , he meant to me the world , and if i did anything he did anything .
i did n't tell him , but he found out .
i do n't want to hurt him . i do n't want him to hurt him .
what do i do ?
thanks for reading .
are you on any drugs or they get any post ?
you should talk to the nurses or your gp and tell what 's going on .
the school teacher can be able to tell that you can tell .
if you tell them you can help you .
if you keep it <unk> , it will likely only get worse .
i trust me , it 's better that these things get in the early than letting them even get worse .
please do n't do this .
i 'm 17 and starting self harm with my arms , last year , but i stopped it a few months ago . 
it 's hard , but you can do it .
i feel so much more happy , but my pain would remind me what i feel at that time and it 's so strong that i want to do such things to me .
and also , strong . you can do it , i find a <unk> at the writing of the <unk> and keep <unk> .
self harm is addictive , but you can overcome it .
remember that self harm do n't define you are .
you can overcome it .
i found in the past year , i find it always checks to me , every time i 'm going out to me , so i think i got a form of ocd to ensure that i do n't lose anything or not leave anything . 
i often have to check two times 1 go , and after 30 then , i can n't resist my check again , for some reason . 
why is this ?
am i crazy or something ?
it is the most often that it was still many 1 days , and it 's still 1 1 day , would this be in any extent , is this a " extent " ocd ? 
what can i do with this ?
if i 'm not checking , i 'd get very <unk> going away with 15 after 15 @-@ 30 minutes , but so i can n't wait that long , so i can n't wait for that long . 
i feel that i would be doomed if i lost my <unk> or phone .
i just wish i could go out with no way to leave something to leave something or lost something . 
i do n't really know what to do and fear to go to the general second .
they will probably never hear some of the compulsion like this and i just do n't know what to do .
any of you have a similar ritual ?
people think i 'm crazy , but it 's a very strange to get you out of this .
how can you advise me ?
i used to do this in my way to college . having a list of items i know to have on myself and use my <unk> check on the bus .
i have now had a more more anxiety and i think this is a warning sign , so i just try to <unk> the habit of the habit , and definitely visit your doctor , but also tell you to say you do n't keep this thing .
the doctor saw the case much worse , do n't worry about that .
i do ocd out of the <unk> class today : <a <unk> <unk> </a> . 
maybe it 's the way to get rid of it just to avoid the actions of <unk> , so do n't check your loss of something and just leave it .
while the level of your anxiety increases in a period , it has gradually decreased , your ocd is hoping to disappear today . 
that just sounds over to me , rather than have a really bad ocd . 
i 'm very obsessed with getting up 20 1 every night to check that all the lock in my house would be a lock at particular . 
sometimes i 'm not going to be locked , although i know they were locked .
when the <unk> really <unk> your routine every day , i think it will become a real problem . 
you are definitely not crazy , worry , and i 'm sure your gp understand the issue .
i went to the post for the other other reason and they encourage me to pick the number of which i checked , and stick to them , and cut down , and cut down .
i think my taught was a idea and i am still ok if i checked 5 or 20 check .
i 'm a lot better , and i think it 's definitely a hope that anyone who wants to improve .
i 'm pretty pretty calm on things , i like to take it as it comes as they come , and i 'm not too much worried .
on the last 1 and 2 months i found it has become really <unk> on things , and i 'm not talking about a mere feeling of nervous . 
i 'm beginning to feel that there is no irrational panic in a variety of things that i have n't even <unk> my mind as far as far as something that <unk> <unk> <unk> in my head .
i 'm not sure if this is causing the lifestyle changes ( or a sign of other issues ) or a sign of other issues , but it 's beginning to give me a bug because it affects me confident and happy free students .
i speak it to a few people , including my parents , but the same people all think i should have <unk> my actions and go to a random phases until the serious problem is clear .
so wonder what is the best thing to do ?
you speak to the doctor and see if the anti @-@ anxiety pill could take off the edge off things ?
i see i can speak to a counsellor ?
or should i take the advice of the close people around me and just eye an anxiety until the anxiety becomes a problem ?
well , i should n't start trying to eye your anxiety , because it makes me <unk> and more likely to be more panic there .
i recommend to try to focus on something as soon as you start to feel a bit of panic , making your <unk> or feeling that you 're more happy .
or if you can n't do that , when you start to feel a panic , when you start to feel your friends , you get to make you laugh . lol it worked for me and suffer random panic attacks .
it started that i 'm just really worried about a tiny thing , although not as severe from things like you .
i find it 's helped to just talk about someone else to make you <unk> .
i find to mention my mum to my mum and see the situation that i should have reacted to the situation that i should react to the situation , but perhaps it 's a way that makes me feel better about it , so i know i know it is a big deal and i do n't need to be <unk> about it .
but if it gets worse , go to the doctor .
i have a friend who suffered severe anxiety that can prevent the house to leave the house and doing things so worried about what they can go wrong .
the doctor gives her medications and they made her much better .

an independent expert stated that iran 's latest agreement with the iaea is short of west 's demands to halt more nuclear sites and information to halt the production of concentrated uranium which could potentially used to bomb . 
u.s. 's state department administration spokesman tom casey stated that iran officials had not met any international obligations regarding nuclear programs but the report can offer some new details of the country 's development or <unk> <unk> into the program .

nsg officials do not want to be obstacles to the india of the largest countries and the united states of the most powerful country .

the survey showed the cultivation of poppy cultivation in much afghanistan and was overwhelmingly concentrated in the 34 of the 34 provinces of most of the southern provinces where the insurgency remains strong . 
the survey was issued on 11 27 , 2008 . 
the united nations found results that the amount of land devoted to opium in afghanistan would be reduced by 19 % , despite total of the total <unk> of opium opium dropped just 6 percent . 
the study stated that high gross output is attributed to a good growing growth season in the south . 
the southern region was a heavy <unk> area where taliban maintained strong presence in 5 provinces and systematic encouraging opium cultivation to finance its insurgency for several 1 years . 
u.n. estimates that the insurgents have made much 300000000 dollars in opium trade last year . 
costa said a lot between <unk> and <unk> are able to be funded by a lot of war in war . 
the taliban produced the amount of opium which far exceeds the world 's demands due to the multi @-@ type of bumper crop 3 years . 
costa said the result was a bit of depression that the price dropped approximately 20 percent . 
costa said the evidence of the taliban , drug lord , some farmers and even even farmers have been <unk> by the price that has already collapsed . 
the increasing amount has also been processed in afghanistan . 
costa added that the insurgents held a significant amount of opium . 
costa said much as much a surplus , much more than more than more than the world demands the world over the last 3 years . 
united nations found afghanistan produced 8500 tons of opium in 2008 . 
the world 's demand was estimated to about 4400 tons of year . 
taliban stands the passive in the cultivation and has less pressured afghanistan farmers to plant opium poppies . 
this will then support the current price .
