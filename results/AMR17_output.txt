<unk> support the thread that started a thread , i 'll reply to <unk> the poem .
pledged fighting in your death to defend diaoyu islands and @-@ related island . 
<unk> the <unk> boat . <unk> japan little <unk> are stirred up trouble and unrest . they showed their <unk> appearance again with the theft and <unk> forms . 
never go back back to that time we have been <unk> when we signing the treaty . be strong , the sword is sharp and <unk> the knife is buried the enemy . 
2010 @-@ 9 @-@ 11 
i agree with the analysis of the thread that started the thread . if the war really comes to , i 'd like it up , if the war is really comes i would be hua mulan for protecting our homes and defend our homeland , spreading our china 's <unk> , and pledged to fight our national dignity defending our national dignity . 
i very much wish to be born when mao zedong 's <unk> <unk> long march was to lose my head , shed my blood , completely <unk> all of the china 's wrong enemy , and spreading our <unk> <unk> . 
how do we state japan ? 
my fellow citizens .
hello everyone . now we all know about september 18th , japan is now a <unk> plan for another sea incident like another , another lugou bridge on the sea . 
japan is surprised defying the whole world 's strong condemnation and it was openly invaded the sacred territory of our country ( diaoyu islands ) . 
we all know that diaoyu islands is always belongs to china . for history reasons , the fact that the original belongs to us is <unk> . 
my fellow citizens are our fellow citizens , why is we going to go even further , because japan wants to create the facts of the occupation ? we can allow this ? we can we allow ? 
japan 's militarism brings down a grave disaster to the asia fellow citizens . 
china has suffered japan 's <unk> for several decades for several decades . 
in northeast , the japan unit 3 had cruel human body experiments on china living , korea and other countries in extreme brutal methods in northeast , the nanjing massacre added to the ancient capital , not <unk> away to the capital . the big battle in hengyang and changsha will have barely <unk> over 1000 kilometers ( <unk> miles ) bones . 
to my fellow citizen , it 's too many instance about the mass crimes committed by the japan in china , which is a difficult record <unk> of all <unk> <unk> . 
just like those <unk> soul who lost their lives in over pacific ocean and found it difficult to rest in peace . 
still , all those who have experienced that era <unk> remember the <unk> . when we turn into this historical page and read it , even our younger generation will also cry in a <unk> of <unk> down in our cheek , and our blood is <unk> <unk> .
japan actually wants to reverse the verdict of history of their aggression , so that would wake up fellow citizens and china in asia . 
we have to go face to face this 100 year of shame , though we are having looking back at this 100 , but do we have to create history , and choose the history of history , although not to resolve the history of the history . 
there is no responsibility why we are afraid . the territory is related to the matter of dignity . it is small , no interest of the country and national <unk> guarantees the honor , regardless of how wind and cloud changes . we can n't let our native land separate , even if they were <unk> in wounded .
from my fellow citizens the 21 st century means that the china nation is when we are <unk> in the inside , but we face many challenges to the outside . 
what way should we go with the taiwan issue , tibet , south china sea , the surrounding environment or foreign forces to china ? 
what is doing a fellow citizen , please look at the world map , and the <unk> shaped @-@ shaped @-@ shaped are suppress our breath , <unk> our development , and <unk> our national territories .
we never afraid to make our enemy , but we do n't want to . we are n't afraid of war , but we do n't want the war .
we need to have an arms arranged and strengthen all military forces in the land , sea and air .
the china nations had been <unk> several times , but has never had the ambition of expanding their territory in <unk> . 
we do not impose a strategic foreign security philosophy that apply to others , because we do n't impose what we do n't want to .
the country and <unk> of the country are like an individual and <unk> , we need to insist that we 're not hurt , but we avoid hurting others .
the <unk> is certainly not afraid , the event does n't have to be cowardice .
china 's side <unk> for japan 's war repair for world war ii @-@ is <unk> by china . 
people's heroes monument is a <unk> history of my fellow citizen with china nations strive to the continued improvement . 
all set men represent the sacred expectations of peace .
from my memory , my memory <unk> <unk> a thought of thinking , in my mind , it <unk> many of the <a <unk> <unk> scene on the <unk> spears and armored horses .
what i think goes through that deep history of the generation , as i see the famous state of u.s. , who even 100 years ago , <unk> alone in his audience hall , and the former u.s. president who thinks he achieved unification of the territories , and that thinking the integrity of the union at his audience , is also a former u.s. president who is happening to the <unk> of the union . 
anyway , to forget the war is certainly dangerous in the world : we do n't have to exercise <unk> , but we do n't have to exercise <unk> , though we want development and peace . ( in modern ) . the boxer protocol of the nation is poverty and humiliation , the fall behind the nation is poor and backward . 
if not strength , what would peace come ?
we have to focus on national defense education and build up a great wall and establish a full range system of national defense systems able to attack and defend . 
the best attack defense . we should strengthen forces and improve a great deep combat ability to engage in our ultra long range attacks , and in the premise of the premise of the defense industry in all <unk> , increase the investment of the great distance and construction of the national economic development , and in order to avoid influence on national economic equipment , and establish a high quality of high - high quality divisions , and establish a high high @-@ tech division .
the battle <unk> are about to sound , and people are already fully equipped , and they are ready to go .
we <unk> nothing without the people who do n't support us but we are all powerful with their support .
time when we say no other people to my fellow citizens , so we have to achieve .
1 . establish the guaranteed funds are established , the work environment and work mechanism are improving , hundreds of thousands of information technology <unk> <unk> from united states and around the world to china . 
2 . creating a few battle of nuclear power carriers to be created .
3 ) it was manufactured by various kinds of advanced combat aircraft . 
4 . the research and deployments on the high speed of icbms that could break more than 10000 location_0 miles on a range of missile defense system is accelerating . 
5 . a nuclear experiments were resumed and military force established in space .
6 . 1000 tons of nuclear bombs equal as 10000000 tons of tnt and middle @-@ range missiles be installed in all of the short @-@ range missiles and middle missiles when it needs nuclear warheads . 
7 . 30 strategic nuclear submarines are retain , capable of <unk> 3 devastating nuclear strikes to the enemy . 
8 ) have been abandoned commitment to first for no use of nuclear weapons .
9 ) the right of <unk> <unk> <unk> will be retained .
only if we were confident and improve us , we can strive to our strong , qin shi huang unification of china . zheng chenggong recovered taiwan . zheng chenggong had to carry on our <unk> , and <unk> and strong will have to carry up with our <unk> . 
now those piece of the land are shaking far away from the motherland 's embrace , <unk> and calls . let 's carry forward a fellow general , a fellow citizen with a <unk> move forward with our <unk> wish .
when i read history , <unk> and anger in my heart are <unk> into the nation 's concern . i 'm willing to serve our country and i am born to a cloth <unk> , but i 'm not <unk> if i 'm born to the <unk> and a common person for the motherland and it was <unk> , even if i die . i 'm adequate to show my sincere patriotic heart .
here , i <unk> the poem in <unk> forms of ci (poetry) to voice my heart 's aspire . 
painting the deep red <unk> .
protect diaoyu islands . 
we are bitterly losing our ryukyu islands . 
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall in other countries ? 
100 years of <unk>

2002 @-@ 6 @-@ 26 
the other articles : so ... 
why do n't we fight a little japan ? 
what are the china still tolerated ? 
they even ride our head .
is this still what the moment with the <unk> still do this ? 
we should tell the whole world that others can n't be bullied china at time . 
time we show our strength . china is too long . 
all our citizens of our citizens are currently too <unk> . the officials were too near .
we already have no <unk> now ; china needs to start war . a harsh slap for the faces of the united states <unk> . 
let they know that us is not <unk> . if we won , then we can increase influence from china , and citizens <unk> are improving . if we lost , we can clean up an <unk> <unk> and make the trash get out of the <unk> and to be <unk> and let china go up . 
go china ! !! 
i suggest china will strengthen its guard against diaoyu islands , guarded and protecting the <unk> and the sovereignty of our country , and whether the japan dares to invade our territory with military force , we would fight a small scale war to defend ourselves . the china cannot lose . 
in life we need a show , but it 's really p. to show you embrace by someone .
just past .
the whole society , including the stars , is like this .
damn not <unk> .
it 's totally unacceptable .
agree with the cheap <unk> ... they are somewhat sense of what they are <unk> in china <unk> . 
their lives are looking for <unk> .
a group of 9 professional 
hard to life .
shocking .....
that is normal . and the whore is always heartless and the <unk> is <unk> .
they want money but they do n't want face .
look at the wolf with ms. fan , near ms. fan , you know that the actors had to drink with him or not to force out or even . 
<unk>
okay , as long as something <unk> and eat .
no one is easy , what a life is like show , you have to look like a script to know how performance is .
all that is somebody .
top imperial examination <unk> at all 360 life walking . so there are so effort and <unk> behind the top imperial examination scored the imperial examination . this has <unk> a <unk> <unk> word . 
haha .
<unk> .
reality .
shoot those hooligans .
- <unk> <unk>
- <unk> <unk>
the entertainment circle is dirty . all men in it are bird , the <unk> and scum .
it pity them but who blame ? that 's not easy for that star female .
everybody does this , how can you make money money if you do n't .
when women are in front of others , they will be proud , but when he stayed alone .
nowadays , nowadays , the star are just going to be plain put in ancient times , they are in ancient times . they are now famous , because they are the famous prostitute , or even sleeping with high officials , or even sleeping with some high officials , they should just be normal .
stop talking about other people . just behavior .
what should we be done in future . the ability alone were n't enough for success ? we face such a hard choice too ?
no more suffering is <unk> into the look of the international .
it 's not so bad , they just play out of mind out of mind .
but the old zhang jizhong , who <unk> hooligans in her circle , also thinking that it is not <unk> , he made a tv series when she has nothing to do the people of the whole country . 
both took what they need .
when can china have a complete girl pure girl ? 
now , in the entertainment world , the story was very shocking in the world . rumors hsu yuki has been forced out because the company refused to drink with a guest and has to switch to work over lawyers assistance instead of making the end meetings . 
super <unk> <unk> have often encountered social engaged or circumstances that they are not welcome but they have to join it .
after all , they can n't decide many things , because that 's having to do with many aspects , and many people 's interests .
sometimes , just a normal stupid party that seem to us , can n't be that simple for the stars , just like we imagine .
the star had a lot of contracts and if they <unk> well , their sources of money rolls . if she did n't get <unk> well , force her <unk> or even the frame will come her <unk> .
a smart <unk> female is 2 kind of the first kind of the first kind that those are always holding very high integrity , and they are simply rejected all such invited . 
the second kind of people are good to play the trick and achieve their objective through their seeds .
it is rumors that even some star female <unk> won their first role in this way .
after drinking some alcohol drinks some alcohol or show the show , they might have a chance to lie on his shoulder , feel his chin , or <unk> her parts , or the most <unk> of the <unk> attitude most will be the most .
they are the very 9 <unk> . 
just those star pretend and they actually live a much better life than this .
agree with the cheap <unk> ... they are somewhat sense of what they are <unk> in china <unk> . 
agreed .
oh well , not easy to people .
they deserve it . they ask that .
there is nothing easy with me .
women are more birds and the men are worse than and and .

it would take no long .
late in 2004 , the route 8 ( <unk> ) that runs around the southwest <unk> of richmond new urban region was open . 
it 's already going to change development patterns because it makes a development pattern and caused traffic around its exit <unk> <unk> <unk> .
today , richmond times-dispatch told the offer about the impact of huguenot trail , powhatan county . 
will jones reported that traffic in 1 section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since 8 's opening . 
speed and accident are <unk> as well .
so far this year was reported , near the intersection of the winterfield road , located near the quantity_1 accident , up for all quantity_1 accident in 2004 . 
virginia department of transportation engineer dale totten noted that if they have more money , they would have the 4 <unk> on the road at about $ 13000000 . 
of course the vdot has no money to construct roads in the richmond region . 
because because of local politicians and <unk> , vdot spent all their money of this money . 
where did homer simpson homer simpson when you need him ? 
oh , this is a major moment .
in our prediction , route 8 will generate the development of the electricity , which <unk> a country local road in a scarce population area all around its exit . 
other people have chosen where they work and live where they live , but there can be traffic relief from people who drove to back and forth between the chesterfield county . 
and they create traffic <unk> in new places .
i am surprised that this is only rapidly .
even i think it could be lagging 3 years or 4 years . 
think it would be liable for route 8 to create all of their exit , because it already created a $ 13000000 road construction on this 1 exit . 
another prediction .
after a few years of <unk> development and approved for a mega commercial project in the intersection of major roads , the need for need to be a new road of roads , for a few more 1 years . 
well , before the decades ended , we can see the funding liability will be through the well past of the original 400000000 dollars , which is taken by building the op . 
route 8 is such a great idea , <unk> <unk> . 
thanks for nothing .
i think we can spend $ 400000000 elsewhere . 
i think you should n't blame 8 for creating those people . 
what is the alternative if they were enough to create a new <unk> of traffic in new places ?
additionally , traffic is <unk> in the old place ?
now you understand what people like the tmt in fairfax feel . 
i usually take my position on favor of road .
but 8 definitely has been excess with the <unk> needs in other states . 
there was virtually no traffic for the richmond . 
the rush hour lasted 30 minutes . 
and you 're giving them a " a largely rural area through a largely rural area .
the road is nowhere .
just think this money may be spent on another cross @-@ potomac facility or the road is desperate needed in nova . 
yes virginia centrist , the insult , the rest of the state helped pay the 8 during injury last year , adding it out of injuries , adding the debt . 
we 're very nice to be obliged .
not much sense though .
the old problem is it .
if you get ahead of need then you 're accused of <unk> <unk> .
if you built at the place of an already acute needs , you claim you can n't bring your way out of the <unk> .
anonymous 
that is a fair point .
 makes a good point . 
however , this situation <unk> the report of the state by the state of the state found that the ctb and vdot funding transport projects based on transport projects based on the best lobbying , rather than based on a comprehensive plan to the state . 
i 've submitted this a disgrace situation that should not be tolerated .
and senator chichester and his <unk> poured more money into this flawed institution so this is getting worse . 
what 's the point of transportation expenditure ?
in virginia it is for the benefit of private business plan and is not for service to the public interest . 
all wrong are wrong .
not less walter stoch stated that it is intended to pay the money for economic development for 8 . 
come on folks .
i do n't understand your point tmt . 
when last of the last or you are n't going to be for some sort of business , when you 're not going to stick with traffic ?
seems to me it 's the whole point of the road to facilitate interest of public in getting a private business and get from them .
as of course , the support of business is overwhelming , even though the grandmother was on sunday , the trip of the people 's location and a soccer game .
not wonder we suffer to the <unk> problem because our road expenditures are not matching the increase of business or domestic state products .
if we recognize the primary benefit for the business , we should do 2 things . 
let business of course pay for us more transportation bills , and we are incentive to locate them for the least more <unk> for the system , even if it means more overall travel .
why is it so hard to understand it ?
the solution is a functioning pattern of human settlement and therefore balanced the capacity of transport systems to demand travel generated .
spin on all else .
emr 
tmt said it is for the benefit of private business plan and is not for service to the public interest . 
i do n't see this statement point as they appear to demonize private business plan and put public interests above all else .
i think they are tight <unk> so they are virtually the same .
the local problem is obvious for these events being <unk> .
but if we <unk> business long enough we 'll eventually find us all work in the devil .
i do n't see for claims to be a solution to the balance of the dynamic nature ever changing .
you see a rail to dulles as a job center that is a job center that promotes a <unk> demand demand . 
i agree .
in fact , that may be enough reasons to build it all on .
all the same logic should be applied to the road .
to use our investments , they should have a destination in both end .
we need more places to get closer to the balance we said we need more .
here is the reality check .
i drove past the watkins landing at the morning and the evening . 
i was <unk> back and forth with my work back and forth . 
i 've never seen anything remotely like the flood of trafficking .
it is a 55 @-@ <unk> zone at the car of the 75 @-@ 100 and how much is the morning ? 
it has already been planned to widen huguenot trail because the development of the chesterfield side is heavily demanded and a new school and a whole bunch of development that has been <unk> through robious road 1 years ago . 
8 is the wonderful of those of us actually using them , rather than the <unk> of powhatan and the west of chesterfield . 
we can our commercial development , and we can work closer to our lives .
you can think that is not rational use of land .
i have no desire to live in any city .
i refuse to work in the downtown area .
i refuse to use mass transit that is not safe for a <unk> female who worked long hours for regular hours .
and i happen to like the development of a large lot .
i do n't understand how exactly i 'm supposed to keep a horse in 1/4 acres ( <unk> ) lot . 
1 gallons of gas can go for $ 10 . 
and i still pay to live in the country .
many people are legitimate <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , small types , certain types , making not wanting to live in urban core .
i 'm truly baffled by this <unk> in the city living .
anonymous  , if you wish to live in the country you are every right . 
but you are not the right of the rest of the state to <unk> the construction of the 400000000 dollars of the $ 400000000 to be easier for shops and get working . 
as a debate between 8 , else that may be spent 400000000 dollars in the 8 debate is consistently <unk> . 
if money applies to other press and even roads , it might be <unk> , much of trafficking <unk> is <unk> .
ray hyde , my comments are directed at investors who lobbying to place roads near their own property , and the <unk> system that fund this requests no matter whether it was linked to a master 's transportation plan , or lack of <unk> . 
i was 24 and mother of a 2.5 year old mother . 
since 8 , i have broken up the father 's father since 8 . 
i want to start dating other people and the father said my son would have nothing to do with him .
he 's very suffering , he was very <unk> , but because we are together , he 's not right .
too much goes on in his life right now and although i told him no love and not love me , he thinks we could work .
i want him there with his son , without need me , too .
but no one has no one . his family did n't get along with him and he and have an issue .
i do n't want to be miserably anymore and if he were around longer , i would be more miserable .
i do n't want him there with his son for his son because he was a good father or at least trying to .
i believe every children need both parents , though they are together or not .
but he thinks if he could n't have me , no one could have me .
what did i do , move in my life ?
it 's very bad of your ex @-@ threats to you using your son .
you must not give into that because if you are giving into it , it 's just <unk> .
you 're right to live your life and happy , so you do n't cave because of his threats .
if he really loves his son ( regardless ) , he saw his son , but this is just an typical economic method used like people .
other people say i 'll kill me if you left me , would it get through you ?
you will be a date .
meet all the kind of people .
do what you want .
if he 's voluntarily to walk out of your life you would probably be better off to both you do n't have .
i agree , 1 other thing is that he 's not his business or date . 
i did n't tell him .
not because he 's threats , but because he 's not concerned about your personal life .
can you document his threat ?
you really need ...
quit taking him calling and make him leaving a voice mail .
make him an email or text you .
keep that record .
get a lawyer and divorced a divorce .
try legal aid if you can n't afford one .
tell your ex , that all communication needs to go through a lawyer .
the bus driver and people around and those who deliver your food want exactly change .
do n't they realise that you do n't get a change pile in the bank ?
does someone have to take the notes somewhere ?
people get lazy .
as i do n't like to count the copper all day , i would like to be near as possible .
if you take 20 pounds of note on bus , they just told you that you get on the bus . 
it is illegal to pay certain amounts in a load coin like you can only pay something like 30 <unk> 1 <unk> . 
hello , i started university in 9 , but obviously i am not immediately <unk> it like most people . 
however , i know that i know it takes some time for me , i 'm always a few , <unk> , especially <unk> , and all of the rest .
all my <unk> and i went out at the first night when i was here and it 's the biggest thing i have ever done .
when i was <unk> i went into a student union bar .
but more point : facts are facts :
after i was here for about 5 months i do n't enjoy uni . the course is disillusioned . i do n't enjoy me , i do n't like a set project to deliver the course much . 
it 's like a much better than it seems .
i 've started the first term for the first term . the financial finance has been delayed , adding to my stress as a level , and i am so worried about all of the <unk> in a pile , so i can n't progress my work .
i was assigned to a counsellor at uni and i saw her for about a block session for about 5 weeks , and if i am honest , it really does n't work out because i 've never open up to them . 
only half heart .
i 'm on my neck load of work now , i have to hit major deadline , and anxiety result in feeling all the time .
i no longer have a counselling because you can only have him at a time , as you can only have so many time at a time , and i doubt that i would help me much this time if i already help me .
i lack the right , i do n't feel to be comfortable as my <unk> and i feel i would feel want to give <unk> , but i can n't brought up to give it up and aspire to someone who ends the death ( and i aspire to be someone ) .
i would rather die as education and not living the life i wanted to live , and i 'm getting the matter out of dropping the university .
i 'm 21 , i turned 22 year year this year , i have no much time left to fail , i have to do something . 
i fail for college once and do another course to be able to get into uni and i do n't want to go through the system and a consistent fail .
can someone please give me some advice ?
maybe go and see your doctor and see the way you can get extending your <unk> in trying to try a bit of pressure ?
send an email like this post , it considers an mitigate circumstances , do n't worry because they see all some more <unk> things before working in the <unk> department , because i know , because i know it was much more comfortable .
break up your work with a chunk you can manage .
concentrate on a time of a time , 1 bit of work ( obviously the most urgent assignment ) . 
dont <unk> yourself with your <unk> and do well do it because you try a new thing from the very beginning .
i recommend you go to see your doctor too .
maybe you would benefit to speak to someone if you are always <unk> . my friend gets a therapy from nhs because of anxiety , so it 's really normal . 
and try to get the <unk> extension . if you 're honest , your university allows it .
it 's got hard to keep strong and keep on the living .
my mum divorced , she had a horrible time with my step @-@ father , and she found her new freedom she found to round her off .
she was a <unk> and <unk> depression with a huge problem of anger .
she was constantly horrible for me .
when i was home i can n't cope with her <unk> and a nasty nasty remarks .
at my break point , i am 18 @-@ year who had 95 time , with a full time of high @-@ pressure school in private forms of private school . 
i can n't work at home , because she shouts at me .
so then i 'm angry for my teacher .
she was lovely at one minute just like i had my organization_0 back , and then turned into the most <unk> living humans in the next minute .
i 'm not going to pass my a2 and i have already accepted to be defeated and this year of my life makes me failed . 
who knows maybe i can come back from this - the university offers to me , but i can n't even accept it . i never made the grades .
i wish i could wiped her out in my life . things are so much better without her .
but then i think i 'm just being selfish .
but surely i do n't mean how i live to this , is it ?
it should be so much better .
but like i do n't control this spiral towards the work , i feel .
and i do n't know what to do .
thank you for reading .
nice <unk> !
you can n't get a section of her because of that .
did she even have a history of mental ill or diagnosis ?
sure , you do n't know if you do n't get good grades so if you can accept the place .
life threw things at you all the time .
outsiders will be if there were n't someone part of your family .
i have to deal with a verbal year long before i came to uni before i came to uni , before my dad is the only reason that was the only reason it is . 
if you really want out , you work hard .
really sounds like you need support somewhere else unless she can n't give you support if she <unk> .
can you call childline or something like them ? 
you can go to the library on saturday and study there for a good 8 hours . 
can you go to your friends 's house in the form of student groups ?
do you want a section of her in the arse and blame it on all your problems ?
i know what you feel .
my mum is <unk> from hell too .
i highly should take up smoking .
oh , tsr grew up and stop <unk> . it 's a joke . 
i think i 've become a much more weak person in the past 1 @-@ 2 and have <unk> my personality down in a way to try to make friends with some people at university . 
but it 's going to lead them into people to believe that they can say or do me the hell they want to me .
they have shown absolutely no respect .
eg hello , someone from university , and ignored me , but you decided to help to help some work and gave them it . 
it caused a lot of anger in my life and <unk> in my life and it really started to affect my concentration in university .
does anyone get any experience to handle this sort of things or how to go to gain some respect again ?
you just say no.
if you are not particularly comfortable with it , you will gradually do it .
you can start sorry to not , but i was busy .
of course , you do n't go to the top over it with it to go into a complete opposite direction .
if you think no mind in mind , then you say .
when they start to realize that you did n't bend over to them , they started more respect for you .
well , this is such a bad attitude , of course , you can be respected . if you 're nice but you just let they do anything you can , you 're not nice , that is a fool person .
i do n't know if anyone has read this , but i just feel desperate and i feel i need to tell someone .
i leave home in 9 and start at uni to do this , but i 'm incredibly anxious to do this , but here is now i am here and i am all about it , over 2 weeks of weeks i 'm feeling it 's all overwhelmed and i 'm feeling not intelligent and social awkward . 
i 've been an emotional struggle in a majority of life since i was moved to a secondary school , even though i lost my dad around 9 , and i always blame it for my feelings . for roughly 15 months from 12 2009 , i have 2 counselling period in my life . 
at the moment , i feel like the problems of my living is , and making me ever more <unk> and making my self @-@ low self @-@ self always doubt work . i can be able to be able to become a very quiet of work and i often find me becoming very quiet during a social occasion and i doubt me .
2 <unk> have not been diagnosed with me , and suggest that i have n't suffered at depression , but i am a huge worried of my dad because of a country that caused my dad . 
i 've tried to solve my problems before , and i find <unk> and <unk> in particular and also try things like the self @-@ help books and a self @-@ help tape i feel my life , but i felt this was my living , i wasted one chance of existence and i got a chance of one a young man i was beaten away .
i simply do n't know what i do , and my friend would never say what i do , when i thought i did , i often say i 'm lazy and i can n't disagree with a lot of times , i feel like people tried everything to help with everything they can , and that time again , and i fail again .
i 'm sorry for anyone who read this <unk> mess , and i have a bit feeling like self sought but truly feel desperate .
it is common that when people are in the new situation and felt pressure to <unk> with strangers and fit that the new role like the <unk> in university , people feel to be more intense .
i 'm not a health professional and i can only speak from my personal experience , so i am strongly suggesting you see you qualified health professionals for what you feel depression and worry about it .
that 's what it 's going to happen . view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view view
good luck .
i think a lot of people feel the same way you feel , but it 's probably not a solution , using your friends by using their friends , it 's probably no better as such as you are depressed , but that 's definitely better than you do you feel free to me , you feel free to your private message .
i focus on the <unk> if i am you , you aspire to someone like someone coming into a bad background , happy , their happy , married , and get married , etc. you do n't want them , you do n't want them , but someone that you have <unk> you respect .
your focus in life is you in life . you do n't state your study or indeed why you want to experience ? because your mum wants you to go ? because your mum wants you ? why do you need a degree for the career that you want ?
either way you <unk> up why you are there and work off your bottom to get the best grades as you have something you can say , but when you get your degree , you have something you can say , and i 've been working hard to and i pass .
<unk> <a <unk> </a>
i hope this helps .
i 'm not pretty <unk> , but i walked on a <unk> but i thought nearly all the time but i thought the doctors <unk> on my toes .
i 'm more comfortable with it .
what makes them decide that walking " <unk> " is a sign of touch because they seem to be so random and not always indicate ?
well i can have a sign of something in the swamp spectrum , but who does n't have 1 things or 2 . 
you guys know what i mean .
the walking on the toes can be a deluded symptoms .
proof is possible to be symptoms of brain <unk> .
the feelings of a lot of tired can be <unk> symptoms .
the symptoms were always applied but if the symptoms of a lot of cases clearly with this instance was worth note , so nothing will ever be diagnosed if there is no notes .
i walked on my toes but because i was born with strange toes that <unk> under the last 2 years to be getting a surgery 2 years ago . 
my brother is a <unk> , but i do n't notice it , but the spectrum is so broad , but i probably have the " <unk> " asperger's , so i have to have a communication problem and i do n't pick up a social reaction @/@ body language . 
but then , i do n't have a proper diagnosis and you even have some symptoms that do n't mean you have a certain condition .
i 've been walking on my toes for my toes because i was told not walking on my toes . 
i have <unk> .
so maybe you 're <unk> or have short <unk> .
it will drill into it to those who do dance @/@ gymnastics , etc. i find it more comfortable now .
i do n't read too much of random symptoms like that .
hello , i am a 12 @-@ year old girl , an self @-@ year an 12 year old , 13 day . 
i started to slit each individual fingers at <unk> and i 've never stopped from that day . 
it 's getting worse because i have my legs <unk> up with <unk> , because i <unk> my legs with the name of my ex - i would n't stop a cut .
i have several <unk> in my arm .
<unk> them and then i cut me for the <unk> <unk> and razor .
i take around 5 <unk> and other drugs and the <unk> when i can n't be found .
when i wrote this , i was really <unk> to cut my arms or burn me .
i 'm an addiction ; once one was <unk> , i cut again .
1 think about it every day . 
i was 12 , and my life is already sick . 
this is the source that my dad left when i was 7 , and did n't want to know me anymore . 
he just cared about his new girl , his wife , and his new life i do n't want me .
my best mate died when i was 10 . 
i was a relationship with a 16 year old boy and my speech is forbidden to me for events and age different . 
my mum also suffered from bipolar , and i have sex . 
i do n't want to stop .
i do n't care what what to me . i want to do it and again again to torture . i hate myself .
but i love my best mate , he means the world , and if i did anything , he would have done anything .
i did n't tell him , but he found out .
i do n't want to hurt him , i do n't want him to hurt himself .
what do i do ?
thanks for reading .
are you on any drug or they get any therapy ?
you should talk to your school or the attorney of your schools and tell them what 's going on .
maybe what you trust is a school teacher you can tell .
if you tell yourself people , you can help you .
if you keep it inside , it probably only get worse .
i trust , it 's better to get these things in the earlier than letting it even get worse .
please do n't do this , please .
i was 17 and starting for self harm last year , but i stopped it a few months ago , but i stop my arms . 
it 's hard but you can do it .
i felt so much more happy i am but my pain would remind me what i feel at that time and how strong i 'm feeling at that time so i want to do such a thing .
and also , strong . maybe you can do it . i found a <unk> .
self harm is addictive , but you can overcome it .
remember , your self harm is the definition of your people .
you can overcome it .
in the past year , i find that i 've always checked my <unk> , every time i went out to me , so i thought i 'll get a form of me to ensure that i did n't lose or not leave anything . 
i often have to check twice 1 go , and then for some reason i can n't resist my check again . 
why is this ?
am i crazy or something ?
it is the most often , and it checks , and it 's still many 1 day when it carrying many things but are rarely carrying them ? this is the " ocd " in any extent ? 
what i can have done with this ?
if i do n't check 15 , i 'd get very <unk> going away after 15 minutes between 30 minutes , but there is much anxiety that i can n't wait that long . 
i felt that if i lost my <unk> or phone , i feel doomed .
i just wish i can go out without worrying about 2 minutes about leaving something or losing something . 
i do n't really know what to do and i 'm afraid that i went to the gp .
they probably never heard of some compulsion like this and i just do n't know what to do .
any of you have a similar ritual ?
people think i 'm crazy , but it 's difficult to get you out of this .
what can you advise me ?
i used to do this during my way to college . having the list of the item i know and i know and used <unk> checks on the bus .
i now have a " severely anxiety " and i think this is a warning sign , so i know it 's just easier to keep into the habit when it was relatively fresh and <unk> to say , definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself that you do n't keep check these things .
- do n't worry that because the doctor saw a much worse case .
i do <unk> <unk> about the ocd , which is the <unk> class today . 
maybe to get rid of the <unk> act just to avoid it , so do n't check your loss of something and just leave it .
despite your anxiety increase in the area , the level of your anxiety has gradually decreased , so your ocd will hopefully during overtime . 
that just sounds like you are overly anxious to me rather than having a really bad ocd . 
i am very obsessed up to get up to check every night to check that all the enemy in my house is locked over . 
even though i know they are locked , i 'm convinced they 're not lock .
i think it will become a real problem when it started really <unk> for your every day , it becomes a real problem . 
you are definitely not crazy , so i 'm sure your gp would understand the issue .
i went to therapy also other reasons , and they encourage me to pick and stick it as a obvious less than 20 , and cut down up .
i think i was the idea of teaching and i am still ok if i checked 5 5 or a 20 check .
so far , i 'm a lot better , i think definitely hope anyone who wants to improve .
i 'm pretty pretty calm about things , i like to take it as it comes , and i 'm not too much worried about things .
however , for the past 1 @-@ 2 months , i found to become really <unk> in things , and i 'm not talking about merely feelings from blue . 
i begin to feel a variety of things that i do n't even worried my mind too much in a beforehand that i am not even <unk> my mind as something that ring the <unk> in my head .
i 'm not sure whether this is because the lifestyle changes , or a sign of other issues to the graduate @-@ free students , but it began to bugs me because it affects my confidence and happy .
i speak it to a few of my parents , but all people do the same think i 'm going to go off my actions and i should have ended my actions until the serious problem was clear .
so wonder what 's the best thing to do ?
speak to it to a doctor and see if the anti @-@ anxiety pill <unk> the edge off from things ?
i see i can speak with a <unk> ?
or should i take a closed 's advice around me and just eye from anxiety until anxiety become a problem ?
well , i should n't start trying to eye on your anxiety , because it makes me <unk> and more likely to be in panic , there is a demise circles there .
i recommend to try to focus on something as soon as you started feeling a bit of panic or feeling more unhappy .
or when you can n't do that , when you start feeling your friends , you get to make you laugh , lol , it worked to me and suffer random panic attacks .
it started me really to be starting to be really worried about my tiny things , but not as severe as you sound .
i find it helps just talk to someone else to make you <unk> .
i find it to mention what i 'm worried about my mum and see the situation reaction to the situation which makes me feel better than it should be , but perhaps a way i know it 's not a big deal and i know it 's not a big deal and i do n't need to be <unk> about it .
but if it makes get worse , go to a doctor .
i have my friend who suffer severe anxiety that he could prevent the house and do things because she was so worried about what might go wrong .
the doctor gives her medications and they make her much better .

the political island in latin america has been shift to <unk> since the late 1990 s . 
in this shift of <unk> , the perceived fail of the free market economics is largely reaction .
the left were elected to lead brazil , argentina , chile , uruguay , ecuador and venezuela . 
chavez 's supporters against the home against united states has a 1 centuries long history of the open history of armed intervention and covert intervention in latin america 's domestic politics and said that it has no right to question the venezuela 's preparing defense for defense .

the deal worked out for $ 186.22 per rifles . 
this prices costs considerable less than $ 825 in the price of the same weapons ordered in the us mail . 
the venezuela government also intended to buy 10 russia helicopters from russia , 6 transport planes from spain and 6 naval craft from spain . 
venezuela officials said the government will negotiate brazil to buy around 24 air support planes and training planes . 
chavez insisted and even the largest military retired critics here agree that the purchase is essential to update old weaponry such as the military of the military from belgium . 
the retired general fernando ochoa antich said that it was exaggerated to say chavez was engaged in arms build . 
ochoa was an defense minister in 1992 when then a failed colonel colonel chavez launched a failed coup . 
ochoa stated that venezuela has not not purchase arms in the past 25 years and said that chavez was not an aggressive bought weapon under threatening his neighbor .

the us government provides no evidence of chavez to arm or fund left insurgency . 
a military analysis between the colombia farc and a specialized in the colombia guerrillas have said the rebels have plenty of weapons of weapons trafficking from drug trafficking and did not interest old rifles or chavez 's assistance .
