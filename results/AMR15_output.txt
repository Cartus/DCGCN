make to fight the diaoyu islands and @-@ related island in order to defend diaoyu islands . 
the <unk> was <unk> . the little japan little <unk> stirred up trouble and unrest , they show again show their <unk> appearance with a <unk> heart and <unk> form , again with them .

i agree with the thread of a thread . i 'd like the <unk> of the <unk> . if the war really come , i 'd like to be hua mulan , to protect our homes and defend our homeland , to spreading our <unk> for our china . i am going to be hua mulan , and i have to fight our china 's killing of our national dignity . 
very much going to be born at that mao zedong 's <unk> <unk> long march , which is an <unk> long march , to lose my head , shed my blood , and completely <unk> all enemies , and spreading our blood <unk> . 
how long will we tolerate japan ? 
yeah , i 'm your own citizen .
hello everyone , but we all know about september 18th , but now the japan are now planning again like another , another ends on the sea , another . 
the japan has been defying its strong condemnation of the whole world and the main territory of our country ( diaoyu islands ) is the open invasion of our country . 
what we know , diaoyu islands has always belong to china by the diaoyu islands . the reasons of history that has originally belong to us , becoming a <unk> . 
for my fellow citizens , our thing is our thing and why is the need for negotiations ? so , can japan go even further ( meaning it wants to create the facts of occupied ? absolutely not ! 
for my fellow citizens , i 'm saying that japan 's militarism will bring the <unk> disaster to the asia . 
especially china has suffered <unk> by japan for several decades . 
in northeast , the japan unit 3 , in northeast , the human body , in order to china live , other people and other countries , nanjing massacre added to the extreme @-@ brutal method of the china . nanjing massacre added to the ancient capital of the capital . the big battle in hengyang and changsha will ever be <unk> away from the <unk> of hengyang , and <unk> everything <unk> and <unk> everything . 
on my fellow citizens , i would say too many instances of <unk> <unk> in china that japan is committed in china , which is going to be <unk> without all <unk> <unk> . 
just like that 10000000 <unk> <unk> who lost their lives in turn over pacific ocean and find it difficult to rest in peace . 
still , all those who experience that era will all remember that . even our even generation is also crying at the <unk> of this history ( and read this history page ) and our blood <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
actually , japan actually wants to reverse the verdict of its own aggression history , because it woke up fellow citizens and china people . 
although we are pain we had to look back this 100 years of shame , we have to go to face it . we do n't create history , and no choice about the history issue of history . 
we are not afraid . the territory are small . even though it is related to the matter of the dignity . the interests of the wind and a result , the interests of the country and national <unk> will guarantee the honor . we cannot let our native land even when they were <unk> wounded .
for my fellow citizens , i say , the 21 th century " <unk> " has meant to be " time " and we are press at the inside of the china nations , but we are faced many and our <unk> . 
what ways should we go for the taiwan issue , tibet issue , the issue of south china sea , the south china sea and foreign forces to china ? 
what do i do , citizens , please look at the world map and if any of a <unk> ring will suppress us breathe , <unk> our own development and <unk> our national territories .
we do n't ever afraid to make our enemy , but we have never afraid of the enemy , but we do n't want to war .
we have to urgent the arms to arranged the arms and strengthen all military forces in land , sea and air .
the china nations has been <unk> several 1000 years but have never had a ambition to expand its territory in the future . 
we will follow foreign security philosophy which apply for foreign security and <unk> , because we do n't impose what we do n't want to other people .
like the individuals and <unk> @-@ <unk> , the country and <unk> of the individuals are like and we have to insisted to hurt other people , but since we avoid them to hurt the other people .
the <unk> are certainly not afraid and the act must be subject .
japan is a <unk> with japan 's war to repair air <unk> for world war ii . 
for my fellow citizens , people's heroes monument is a <unk> history of a china nation which has striving to improve the continued improving . 
<unk> <unk> have represented an and and <unk> expected to peace .
occasionally , in my mind , i have <unk> up with my memory proposal , being <unk> in my mind in my mind . in my <unk> <unk> and armored horses .
as much as i think , i think , the famous and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> kangxi , who <unk> the <unk> of the union in his own <unk> hall , and also the former president of u.s. , who were also in how he achieved a great presence on territory , and the former president of the u.s. . 
the world is certainly dangerous in the world , but it is certainly dangerous about the war . as we want to develop and peace , i would say we have not to exercise a <unk> without that <unk> and <unk> , the boxer protocol of the nation has ever been doing the poverty and backwardness of china and <unk> in the <unk> , the fall behind the country is leading . 
what would be the peace coming to the sake , what would it come ?
we have to focus on national defense education , build up a great wall in the hearts of 1300000000 people and establish a full @-@ range defense nation system capable of attack and defense . 
the <unk> is the best defense . we should strengthen a force engaged in the ultra @-@ long @-@ range attack that can be engaged in all organization_0 , and to improve the great @-@ - great distance development capability and construction of the defence industry , increase the modernization of the defense industry of national , and accelerating high @-@ tech quality and the <unk> of military equipment , and establish a high @-@ tech quality of the national development of military .
the battle <unk> are about to sound , the people are already fully equipped , and are ready to go .
we <unk> nothing without supporting us , but we are all powerful in supporting us .
yeah , for my fellow citizens , i would say " when we said " no other person . so we have to achieve .
1. the guarantee was established , the work and work environment and work mechanisms are improving and hundreds of it <unk> <unk> in united states and around the world <unk> back to china . 
2. creating a few battle of an aircraft nuclear power carriers .
3. 5000 combat combat aircraft is manufactured by various kinds of combat . 
4. the research and deployment of high @-@ speed ballistic missile missiles have been accelerated in terms of more than 10000 <unk> miles systems that could break into missile defense systems . 
5. , nuclear experiments resumed and military forces were established in space .
6. to retain 1000 nuclear bombs equivalent to 10000000 tons of if it is necessary and nuclear warheads were installed in all short @-@ range missiles and middle @-@ range missiles . 
7. , it is to retain 30 nuclear submarine and capable of taking 3 <unk> nuclear strikes on enemy . 
<unk> bringing you to commit nuclear weapons first to not be used .
9 ) retain the right to <unk> strike in a national security .
for my fellow citizens , if we 're confident we 're confident and to improve us , qin shi huang might be able to strive to be strong . qin shi huang is unification of china . zheng chenggong recovered taiwan . we have been able to carry the far seen and <unk> of our <unk> , self @-@ <unk> and strong . 
now that a piece of land will be shaking and <unk> , and called a piece of the motherland 's embrace , and it was saying that the previous general of the motherland is going forward . we were carrying forward an <unk> wish by the previous <unk> .

time when we show our strength . china is <unk> too long . 
all of our citizens of our citizens are currently too <unk> , the officials are too cheap !
we already do n't have a <unk> now . china needs to start the war . the face of countries that follow united states 's touch .

i would suggest that china will strengthen diaoyu islands guard to diaoyu islands , and the protection of the <unk> , and protecting our country and sovereignty of our country , if japan dares to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small @-@ scale war in terms of our territory . china cannot be able to lose .

their life looks like , it 's going to live .
a group of 9 of the 9 were a group of 9 . 
hard to life is hard .
there is a shock .
that 's normal . and the <unk> always are the location_0 , not <unk> and the <unk> .
they want the money , but do n't want face .
look at ms. fan near ms. fan , who have a wolf near ms. fan - you know that the actions have to drink with him , if you 're not forced out or even even <unk> .

as long as something as a <unk> , something will be okay .
there 's no one thing , a life thing like show : you have to look at the <unk> to know how to know .

the top time in all 360 life walked in imperial examination , the top @-@ imperial examination , who were so so effort and <unk> behind the top <unk> of imperial examination . this <unk> the word " <unk> " <unk> " . 
<unk> its <unk> !

reality .
make that logic .
cheap <unk>
cheap <unk>
entertainment circles have been dirty . all the men in it , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
it 's a pity , but what blame ? not that is it no easy for that .
everybody has done this . how can you do you make money if you do n't do .
the woman is a pride when he was in front of other people , but when she stay alone , she was a <unk> group .
over the ancient time , the stars of nowadays is just a popular @-@ put popular , and it is just a popular person . they are now an famous who they are <unk> and even sleeping with some high officials , so they should just be normal .
stop talking other people . just <unk> !
what should we be done in the future ? the ability alone are not enough enough for a successful . do we face such a hard choice too ?
as there is no way that more suffered <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
it 's not so bad , as they just played out in their circle , so they just play out of mind .
however , old is an old zhang jizhong , who also think it was not <unk> , who also think it is not <unk> . when they have nothing doing nothing , he made tv series for her <unk> of the whole country . 
they will take what 's need .
how can china have a innocent girl out ? 
now , the story is very shocking in the entertainment world . there is rumors that hsu yuki is forced out because he refused to drink with the company 's arranged with the family , and he refused to be able to switch to work with a job assistant instead of making the end meeting . 
super @-@ grade <unk> , have often encountered social engage or circumstances , which they are not welcome but have to join it .
after all they can n't decide with many things , because it must do to do many aspects and many people of many people .
sometimes , as well as an ordinary party , we can not be that simple for the stars , very normal party seems like we imagine .
the star of people have a lot of contract and if they were well <unk> , if she did n't <unk> , it will be <unk> for <unk> money . if she did n't <unk> , or even <unk> , or even the <unk> will come her <unk> .
the first time is 2 kinds of <unk> , the first kind of <unk> are always held very high integrity , and that is <unk> rejected all such invited . 
the second kind of people are good for to play the tricks , and to achieve their objective through their seeds .
there are rumors that some <unk> <unk> <unk> would win their first role in this way .
after the effects of some alcohol or a show sponsored , they can have a chance of lying in the <unk> of the stars , or feel their <unk> , and <unk> its <unk> , and the most adopted the <unk> attitudes .

late in 2004 , route 8 @-@ was open on the route 8 , which runs around the <unk> <unk> of richmond new urban region . 
it has already changed development patterns because they are getting worse and caused <unk> out of trafficking <unk> .
richmond times-dispatch @-@ told today that there were a <unk> on impact on powhatan county , powhatan county . 
will jones reported that traffic in the 1 section of huguenot trail has more than doubled since the opening of the 8 . 
the speed and accident has been in well as well .
so far this year , there were reported that a accident near winterfield road 's intersection , up to the dozens of accident all in 2004 . 
virginia department of transportation engineer dale totten has noted that if it has more money will be <unk> 4 of the road for about 13000000 dollars if they have more money . 
of course , the vdot did not have money to construct the road in the richmond region . 
because vdot has spent 8 's <unk> <unk> money for the local politicians and <unk> . 
where would you be homer simpson when you need him ? 
<unk> this is a major moment ,
as we predicted , route 8 generated the development of the electricity in the scarce populated area all around its exit all around the country , <unk> on the road of the country . 
other people choose to where they work and where they live , but limited @-@ access highways could relieved the trafficking from the back and forth the location_2 between the chesterfield county . 
and they create the <unk> of traffic in the new place .
i am surprised that this is the only rapidly .
i think even though i can be behind in 3 years or 4 years . 
think it created a <unk> which route 8 had been created for all 's exit , as it already created a $ 13000000 of the road construction in this just about this 1 exit . 
another predictions :
after a a few more years , a new road development and approved of <unk> commercial commercial projects in 8 will be <unk> for a few years . 
before the decade of the decade , we can see that the non @-@ funded liability came through well to the well past of the original 400000000 dollars that was taken by building the original highway . 
route 8 is such a great idea to think about <unk> . 
thanks for nothing .
i think we can spend 400000000 dollars elsewhere . 
i think you should n't blame 8 for creating that people . 
if they were enough of enough , creating a new <unk> for traffic in new places ?
is the additional <unk> of trafficking in the old place ?
now you understand what people like tmt are like fairfax in fairfax . 
i 've usually taken a position in favor of the road .
but 8 is definitely pissed with the <unk> need of the other states of the state . 
the richmond has virtually traffic but there is virtually no traffic . 
the hours of rush was last 30 minutes . 
and you will give them <unk> through large rural areas .
the road to be away into .
just think that this money can be spent on another cross @-@ potomac facility or the road is improving desperate in nova . 
virginia centrist : virginia centrist , that the rest of the state helped them to 8 at the next year 's budget deal , adding that the rest of them <unk> the debt . 
very nice is that the <unk> are obliged to us .
yet there does n't make much sense .
the old problem is the same one .
if you get ahead of the need , you are accused of why you 're <unk> .
it is claims if you build in a already <unk> needs , you can n't <unk> your way out of the <unk> .
anonymous , 
that 's a fair point .
 makes a good point . 
on the other hand , this situation <unk> the valid to the state report that the state of the state and the vdot will find the ctb and the vdot to fund transport projects based on the world 's best lobbying with comprehensive rather than based on the state transportation of the state . 
this will submit this a <unk> situation which should not be tolerated .
and chichester , and his <unk> , chichester and his " senate " <unk> more money into this known institutions , so this is getting worse . 
what 's the point of transportation expenditure ?
in virginia , it 's for the benefit of private business plan and not to serve the public interests . 
the <unk> is <unk> wrong .
not less walter stoch walter stoch stated it is intended to pay the economic development money for 8 . 
let folks come down .
i do n't understand your point , tmt . 
when the last time where you 're <unk> or from some sort of businesses in some sort of businesses are you stick to trafficking ?
it seems to me that the road is that the road is to facilitate interest in public interest in getting a private business and get from the private business .
there are of course , the business support for the sunday , the trip of a solution , and a soccer game , and the soccer game .
no wonder we suffer a <unk> problem , because our road expenses does not matched the business or domestic state products .
if we recognize the primary benefit of the road , we should do the 2 things , we should do . 
the business will pay us for course , of course , and we are <unk> for us for more transportation bills , and if it <unk> the system , even if they 're doing a system , even if it means that it is a overall travel .
why is it so hard to understand it ?
it 's been solved for a functions of human settlement and the capacity of transport system to demand travel to travel by land use .
it 's a spin of all else .
emr , 
tmt said that in virginia , it for the benefit of the private business planning , and it does not have to serve the public interests . 
i do n't see the point of this statement , since it appears to <unk> private business plan and put public interests above all else .
i think they are <unk> <unk> , so they are virtually same .
obviously the local problem is obvious because these <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
but this if we <unk> business enough , we would eventually find us all for the <unk> !
i do n't see to claim that the balance of the dynamic nature is a solution to the balance of ever change .
you even see the rail on the dulles as it is a job center that promotes <unk> <unk> demand . 
i agree .
in fact that , that could be a building reason for it all on it .
all i say that exactly the same logic should apply to the road .
so we should use a destination at both end , they should have a destination in both end .
we need more places to get closer on the balance that you say to need .
here 's check here to reality .
i drove past the past in the morning of watkins landing and the evening of the evening . 
i <unk> back on huguenot trail and forth on the work . 
i 've never seen anything a remote <unk> of the trafficking .
it 's a zone with 55 @-@ 100 car with how long @/@ 100 car on how is it . 
it has already been planned for <unk> of huguenot trail because the development in the chesterfield side on the chesterfield side was heavy demand , new schools and a whole bunch of developing there were <unk> at 1 1 years ago . 
8 is making us to actually use itself rather than powhatan and the west of the road " lack of the road . 
we can be able to develop and we can work on to live close to our life .
you can think that land used without <unk> .
i do n't desire to live in any cities .
i refuse to work in the downtown areas .
i refuse to use mass transit who is not safe for <unk> a long @-@ long <unk> that was n't regular hours on .
and i happen to like the development of a large lot .
i do n't understand exactly how i am going to keep horses in a lot of 1/4 acres ( i am ) . 
1 gallons of gas can go 10 dollars . 
and i 've still paid for live in the country .
many people would rather prefer horses , hunt , <unk> , small types of small types that they do n't want to live in urban core .
this <unk> of life in cities have truly <unk> me .
anonymous  , you have every right to live in the country if he wishes to . 
but you have no right to <unk> the rest of the state the rest of $ 400000000 dollars that is easier for shops and getting working . 
in the debate of 8 , maybe 400000000 dollars spent , may be <unk> <unk> . 
if the money apply to the other press project or even the <unk> <unk> projects , god could be <unk> , much <unk> of trafficking is <unk> .
ray hyde , i would say that my comments direct as investors who lobbying the road to placed the road to near the property , and the incompetence system that will fund this requests without regard to the and transportation plan or lack of the and lack of a master . 
i 'm 24 , and my mother is in a 2.5 year old . 
since 8 , i broke up to my father 's son . 
i want to start when i date on other people and my father said if i would have nothing to do with my sons with .
he 's very over and very <unk> , but he does n't have been right as we are together .
right now very much right on his life , and even though i told him several i can n't work , i think we could not love him and i do n't love me .
i want him , without having no choice there for his sons , too .
but he has no one . his family was not along him and he and he has a issue .
i do n't want to be miserable anymore , and if he 's longer around , i would be more and more .
i do n't want him there for his sons , because he 's a good father or at least he tried him .
i believe every children needs both from their parents even but they are together or not together .
but he thinks that no one can have me if he could n't have me , he might have been able to have me .
what do i do to move with my life in my life ?
very bad is very bad as a ex @-@ ex sons using you .
you have not to give that it because it 's just <unk> if you do it .
you are right to live your life and get happy , so you are n't <unk> because he is a threat .
if he really love his sons , he saw his sons , but this is just a typical method of control , this is just a <unk> method .
other people say things like i would kill me if you left me , would it get through it ?
be a <unk> .
meet all the kind of people all .
what you want to be what you want .
if he 's <unk> to walk out of your life <unk> then then you would probably have him better .
i agree . 1 other thing it was n't his business to date or not to date . 
i do n't tell him .
not because he 's threat , but because he is n't concerned about you personal life .
can you documents his threat ?
you really need .
quit to take him 's call , make make him to leave a voice <unk> .
make him <unk> or he will text you .
keep that a record thing .
get a lawyer and a <unk> .
try for the legal aid if you can n't afford one .
tell your ex ex @-@ as the need for all communication to go through lawyers .
the bus driver , those <unk> , and your food <unk> want exactly changes .
do n't they realise that you do n't get nothing for a bank ?
does someone have to take the notes somewhere ?
people get lazy .
i would like the most near as possible as i do n't like the copper for all day , as i do n't like .
take 20 <unk> at the bus then you just told you that you get on it , it 's just a lazy thing . 
it 's not a law to pay a certain amount in a load of coin , such as you can only pay something like $ 1 <unk> 
hello , i 'm starting to uni in 9 but i am not obviously <unk> from them immediately like most people . 
however , as i know i know it takes some time to me , because i 'm always very <unk> , as i am very <unk> , all the rest , and all are especially .
all of my <unk> and i went out at the first night when i was here and it 's the most hard to do what i ever have to do .
on my <unk> i went on a bar of student union in my student .
but there will be more point . here 's facts .
after where i was here , i do n't enjoy uni after 5 months . the course is playing me , and i do n't enjoy a set project , and do n't like the course . 
university make out it better than it seems much than it .
i bad started the first term . the financing of students were delayed , <unk> to stress to why , and i am so worried about because of all it is nothing , so i can n't be able to progress my work .
from university , i have been <unk> <unk> and seeing them on an block session for about 5 @-@ 6 weeks , and if i honestly opinion , it won't really work out for it , it never <unk> up with him . 
only the heart <unk>
now , i am loads of myself off my neck work , and i have to hit a major purpose , and anxiety , the result of anxiety that i felt for the time all the time .
i no longer have a <unk> person , because you can have to have it at the time of the time , and doubt i would be able to help me much this time if i am already going to help me this time .
i lacked the courage , i do n't feel comfortable with a lectures , but i felt i want to give out me , but i can n't worry about it , because i end up in the deaths of the deaths and aspire to get someone up , i can n't brought out of it . i 'm able to get out of it , but i 'm not able to get up with it .
i would rather die when i 'm <unk> and i did n't live in life who i wanted to live , and i make a matter when i drop out of uni .
i 'm 21 , turning 21 years , turning 22 years in 22 year and have no much time to fail for me , and i have to do something . 
i failed to college once , and i do another course to be able to get into uni , and i do n't want to go on the system and go to go and consistently fail .
can someone please give some advice to me ?
maybe go and see a doctor , see the way of your doctor and see the way you can get to extend your approval to try a bit of the pressure ?
send your <unk> a email like this post and it consider the surprisingly circumstances , do n't worry because they see all some admit there was n't much more comfortable and i know i know if i work in uni administration , because i 'm used to work in university .
break your work on a chunk that you can manage .
get a 1 bit at the time of work ( and obviously the most urgent <unk> ) ) . 
<unk> your <unk> with your <unk> and do well do it because you try new things from the very beginning . now !
i recommend you go to you to see your doctor too .
if you are always a <unk> , you might benefit to someone if you are always to speak . my friend gets this because of anxiety , so it 's really normal about nhs . 
try get to get a extension of sake . if you 're honest , i 'm sure your university will allow it .
it got hard to keep strong and keep <unk> on life .

i 've not passed my a2 into my a2 and i 've already accept a defeated and that this year of this year would make me a failure . 
what i know , i can come back from this . my <unk> offered to me but i can n't even accept it a <unk> . i did n't ever make it a <unk> .
i wish i can have out her from my life . things are so much better without her .
but then i think , i think , is just being selfish .
but surely , does n't i live into this , surely ?
it should be so much better . b
but i feel like i 'm not control for this spiral to this .
and i do n't know what to do .
thank you for reading .

i had to deal with a verbal 8 years long before my dad before i came to uni and i 'm honest the only reason it 's only way out . 
if you really want out , you 're hard working .
really sound like you need to support your support somewhere , if she can n't consistently give you .
can you call childline or something like it ? 
you can go to a <unk> on saturday and study it for a good 8 hours . 
could you go to your friends 's house for form of student groups ?
it 's a bit pain for her section , you want her a section of her and blame it for all your problems ?
i know what you feel .
my mum was <unk> from hell too .
i highly recommend that smoking is <unk> .
oh , tsr grew up and stop <unk> . it 's a joke . 
i think i became a much more weak person in the past 1 @-@ 2 years and that i am <unk> my personality in a way of trying to try some people in uni to try me in university . 
on the other hand , nice over people who lead themselves to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me or do .
they shown that they do n't have any respect .
for instance i say people from uni and i ignore me in uni but she has decided to want to help some work later and gave them to help them . 
it has caused a lot of angry in my life , and in my life , and it really started to affect my <unk> at uni .
does anyone get any experience to handle this sort of things or how to go to some respect again ?
just say , you are just :
if it was n't not comfortable doing it , it would be gradually do it .
you can start sorry but i am busy but i am .
of course you do n't go over the top way with it to go into a complete opposite direction .
if you 're thinking of your mind , you would say it 's them .
when they start aware that they are not <unk> backwards over them , they will start more respect for you .
well , this is such a bad attitude is really , if you 're nice but you 're not nice if you just let them do anything , then that can n't be a nice , but that is n't a nice person .
i do n't know if anyone read this , but i just feel desperate , and feel i need to tell someone .
i 've left home in 9 and i had started to uni but i 'm <unk> <unk> about doing this , but i 'm not <unk> until i 'm getting here and i was in over 2 weeks and i 'm in over 2 . i felt <unk> and i felt that it all . 
while i was moving to secondary school in a majority of secondary years since i lost my dad around me and i have always blamed it for my feeling for my feeling for about 15 months , i have 2 a life of <unk> when i have lived in 12 2009 until this year around 12 , 2009 . 
at the moment , i feel what a like of a problem in the problems and make i ever doubt my living <unk> and make a low more <unk> with my self <unk> . i 'm able to get the work out , and i often find it becoming very quiet on the society occasion and everything i doubt i am .
2 people who give me <unk> me against me , and have suggested me that i do n't suffer it , but i 'm huge worried about me because of it that cause my dad is dead . 
i tried to solve my problem before , and i found how to exercise and <unk> , i 'm also trying to be useful as a self @-@ help <unk> and self @-@ <unk> , but i feel this i feel that this is that i lived ( and i 'll be a one chance of a young man and i have been beaten away from me .
i simply do n't know what i do , when i thought i was doing , i 'm never <unk> about what i did . and i can n't disagree with it a lot of time and i can n't disagree like people trying to help everything they can try to help , and time again i was failures at time .
i 'm sorry for anyone who read this <unk> <unk> and i feel i feel like the <unk> as self sought , but i feel desperate .
the common thing is that when they are in a new situation and feel that they feel on <unk> with <unk> and fit to <unk> and fit in the <unk> of the university , it becomes more intense .
i 'm not a health professional and i can only speak from my personal experience and so i strongly suggest you to see if you feel about it about what you feel about and worry about it .
at the first time , most of the people do n't feel a <unk> , it 's going to be a <unk> , it 's going to be . blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown blown

i 'm a focus of <unk> if i 'm you going to be with someone who come up with a bad background , happy with her <unk> , getting a family , having a family , marry , you do n't want to be them but you have <unk> you have <unk> .
focus on what you 're achieved in life . you do n't state what you study or indeed . because your mum want you to experience ? because your mum want you to go , you need a degree for a career you need ? so !
either way , you <unk> <unk> why you 're there off and work off your bottom , as you have something you can say you might say , " like you get your degree and not hard work and passed it a better grades .

you guys know what i mean .
the walking on a <unk> could be <unk> , it could be <unk> .
the headaches could be symptoms of brain <unk> .
it could be a lot of <unk> a lot of tired of <unk> .
the symptoms were always applied , but if it 's a lot of cases clearly because of this instance there 's a lot of note , so there 's never been diagnosed if not there .
i walked on my chest but because i was born with a strange <unk> <unk> <unk> with the surgery that has to be <unk> out 2 years ago . 
my brother was a <unk> @-@ , but i do n't notice it , but the one would probably have , and i would probably have a <unk> @-@ <unk> asperger's so i have a problem in communication and to do n't pick the social reaction @/@ body language . 
but then , i do n't have a proper <unk> , and you even have some symptoms , and you can n't mean that you have a certain conditions .
so for 1 years 1 've been told to walk on my <unk> , so i 'd walk on on my <unk> . 
i have a <unk> .
so can you be <unk> or have a short <unk> .
it would be <unk> for people who do <unk> <unk> <unk> etc. so i find it more are more comfortable .

thanks for reading .
are you on any drugs or they get any therapy .
you should talk to your school or your general <unk> telling things on your schools .
you can have a school teacher which you can tell .
if you tell people you could help you !
if you keep it on inside , it would likely only get worse .
so i am myself ; it 's better to get these things as early as it could , rather than they are even worse .
please do this , do n't do this .
17 age 17 and i 've started to start with self harm in the last year , but in a few years ago my arms has been cut . 
it 's hard , but you can do it .
i feel so much more happy , but i am scared by the <unk> that i 've been made to see what at that time and i 'm so strong that i want to do such what i want to do .
also , strength , you can do it . i find <unk> in the writing of the <unk> and keep <unk> .
it is addictive of self @-@ harming , but you can overcome it .
remember that self harm is <unk> , do n't remember you .
you can overcome it .
in the past year , i 'd find that i would find to get my <unk> formed , so every time i 'm going to get out the " ocd " to put up at the especially university , so i do n't leave anything if i do n't leave anything or to make it . 
i often have to check off 2 every day , and after some reason i can n't attempt to check again off . 
why is this ?
am i crazy , or am something ?
it was most often when it carried out many things still even every day , but they 've rarely carried out there . this is a extent for any extent ? this is ocd ? 
what much i can do with this ?
if i do n't check , i would get very <unk> going to the sort of going away after 15 minutes or 30 minutes but i 'm often much of as much as i can n't wait that long . 
i feel if i lost my <unk> or phone or i feel it would be doomed .
i just wish i could go out without what i am not worried every 2 minutes or lost something . 
i really do n't know what i did , and i 'm afraid i go to .
they will probably never heard some of this like this and i just do n't know what to do .
any of you have a look similar ?
people think i 'm crazy but is very strange difficult to get you out of this .
what would you possibly advise me ?
i used to do this in my way to college . with which i know , had a list of items i know , and i used to check on the bus on the bus .
now i have more anxiety now and think this was a warning sign , so i know you are just trying to be <unk> off the habit when you are relatively <unk> , and definitely visit your doctor more than doing you , but also telling you to keep checking this thing .
as a doctor saw a much worse cases , do n't worry that about .
on ocd , i do to be on <unk> <unk> class : :p 
maybe it 's a way to get rid of it just to avoid the actions of <unk> , so do n't check it to lose something and just leave it .
although the level of your anxiety has been increased , it has gradually decreased , so your ocd <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
just sound like you 're over <unk> rather than you have a really bad ocd . 
i 'm very obsessed with 20 night , as far as i am going to check out of them in particular , particularly in my house on my house . 
sometimes , as i know they are locked , but i 'm not going to lock them .
i think it has become real problems when obsessed with your 1 <unk> , it started a real problem . 
you 're definitely not crazy , so do n't worry and i 'm sure the general <unk> will understand the issue .
i went to a parade ( also for other reasons ) and they are encourage me to pick off , stick , and cut out a number of 20 times i checks , and cut out .
i think it 's ideas to be a idea , and i 'm still ok at the 5 time or checks , i am still ok .
so so i was a lot more better and i think it definitely hope anyone who want to improve .
i was usually pretty calm as things i 'd like to take it ( as it comes ) and i am not too much worried .
however , in the past 1 @-@ 2 months i find me to become real <unk> about things and am not talking about the nervous <unk> <unk> . 
i 'd begin to feel that a variety that was n't too much to do i had n't <unk> my mind without a irrational , which is even too much as something , so in my head , to ring <unk> <unk> in my head .
i 'm not sure whether this is a reason for a change ( ie <unk> ) ) or a sign of other issues , or if it 's going to a <unk> free person , but it began me to make me because it affected me and happy .
i was talking about it a few people including my parents , but all people think i should have <unk> away with her , and that i should have <unk> my own actions until the serious problem is clear .
so , what 's the best thing to do ?
you speak it to the doctor and see if the anti @-@ anxiety pills can take off the same from things ?
do i see i can speak to <unk> <unk> ?
or should i take the advise of the closed people around me and i 'm just going to bring anxiety until the anxiety would become a problem ?
well , i should not start to try your anxiety that make your anxiety and more likely to be more panic there is there .
i recommend that you are trying to focus on something that make a <unk> or getting a bit <unk> to feel even if you start a bit of a panic , feeling more happy .
if you can n't do that , or you get that your friends make to make a panic , when you start your friends , or i 'm working with me and i suffer her <unk> attacks .
start , although it 's not as severe as you to sound from things like you are just really worried about a tiny thing .
i find help just talking about someone else that make you are <unk> .
i find the mum to mention my mum and see the situation to react to the situation ( which means i should react to the situation ( which it should react to me , and i know it is a better way to me and i know that it is a big deal and need to be <unk> about it . i 'm not a way way that i need to be a big deal and do n't need that to me .
but if it 's get worse , go to the doctor .
i have a friend of my friend who suffered severe anxiety that could prevent the house leaving and doing things so worried about what can go wrong .
doctors have given her medications and it made her a much better .
