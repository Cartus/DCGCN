resolutely well for the people who started thread . i replied to <unk> the poem .
pledged to fight you in defence of diaoyu islands and related island . 
the fish was apart for the fish . the little japan people have stirred up trouble and unrest , they have shown their own <unk> appearance , with a <unk> heart and <unk> form . 
never go back to that time when we appear <unk> when we signed the treaty . strong , china will be strong back . the sword ! the knife and <unk> ! !!! 
2010 @-@ 9 @-@ 11 
i agree with the analysis of the thread , as well . i am going to happen up . if war comes , i would like hua mulan to protect our home , and to spreading our homeland for our home , and i am going to protect our china 's life , and pledged to fight to fight our national dignity , and i am going to die for the defense of our national dignity . 
very much , i wish to be born in that about mao zedong 's <unk> long march long march , to lose my head , shed my blood , completely <unk> all the china enemy and spreading our own enemy . 
how did we tolerate japan ? 
i 'd say my fellow citizen .
hello , everyone all know about september 18th , but now the japan has now <unk> another incident like another on sea , like another lugou bridge on the sea . 
japan defied a strong threat by the whole world , and its openly invaded by our country - diaoyu islands ( diaoyu islands ) 's openly territories . 
as we all know , diaoyu islands has always belong to china . the historical reason has become a <unk> , the fact that has originally belong to us . 
on my fellow citizens , i 'd say our thing and if negotiations needs , and why does japan go even further ? so we want to create the facts of the occupied ? " can we allow this ? <unk> ? 
i am saying that the japan 's 's <unk> would bring the <unk> disaster to the asia people . 
especially china has suffered japan <unk> in long for several decades . 
in northeast , the japan unit 3 <unk> an china living , korea live , and other countries who live in extreme brutal methods on human body . the nanjing massacre has added that the big blood of the blood is never <unk> away from the ancient capital cities . the big battle of the dead battle in hengyang and changsha have barely <unk> over 1000 kilometers ( <unk> miles ) and <unk> everything . 
on my fellow citizen , i 'd say too many instance that the <unk> crime of <unk> japan was committed in china , is all a difficult record of all <unk> from them . 
it 's just like that 10000000 <unk> <unk> who lost their lives over pacific ocean , and found it difficult to rest in peace . 
still , all people who experienced that era <unk> remember all . when we turn into and read this history page and <unk> , we even have also crying down at the <unk> , and our blood is <unk> <unk> , and our blood is <unk> .
actually japan actually wants to reverse the <unk> of the history of their aggression , so it woke up fellow citizens and the china people . 
as if we look back at this , we have to go face to face this 100 years of shame , we are creating history and choose to the history of the history of the history . 
it is not responsible because we are n't afraid . the territory is small . however , the interests of the market is related . however , the interests of the country and the national <unk> will guarantee , even how we change and national <unk> , they cannot let the <unk> of our native land as when our native land is <unk> under wounded .
on my fellow citizen , i am saying that the 21 th <unk> of the 21 th century means that the difficulties was going to be <unk> in the china nation , and we are press from outside , and we are facing many challenges . 
what should we go for taiwan issues , tibet issue , south china sea issue , and the surrounding environment of foreign forces to china ? 
what do i say , do ? please look at the world map and please suppress our breathe , and <unk> our development , <unk> our development and <unk> our national territories .
we do n't want to make our enemy , but we 're never afraid of the enemy . but we do n't want war .
we have to make an arms arranged and strengthen all military forces in land , sea , air and air .
china nations has been <unk> several times several years but never had a ambitions of expanding their territory <unk> . 
we do n't impose the other foreign security philosophy we do n't want to the other foreigners , so we do n't want to the other and <unk> and <unk> .
the <unk> and <unk> of the country are like an individual and <unk> of the individuals and we must be able to insisted that we 'll be hurt for other people , but we 'll have to be hurt .
the <unk> were certainly <unk> , and the war must be <unk> .
china 's <unk> of japan is served as a organization_0 peace for a war <unk> for the world war ii ( world war ii ) . 
to my fellow citizen , people's heroes monument is a <unk> history of a china nation , which <unk> to the continued improving . 
the view of the <unk> represents peace is going to represent peace .
occasionally , in my mind , there have occasionally <unk> a little tragic scene of a <unk> <unk> and armored horses in my mind 's thought of thinking of my memory .
like i saw that the <unk> <unk> '' went through that a famous history of the <unk> ( also ) kangxi , and also the former u.s. president , who thinks the integrity of the union , who has been charged with the <unk> in his audience <unk> 100 years before he achieved a great island , and she is going to achieve the unification of territory in his audience . 
to forget the war in the world is certainly dangerous , i 'd say that my fellow citizen is that we want to be <unk> and peace , but in modern , we have to never exercise <unk> . in modern , the boxer protocol of national and <unk> the nations will aggravated china 's poor and backwardness of china . the fall behind the <unk> . 
if there is no strength , what will be the strength of peace ?
we must focus on national defense education , and build up a great wall in the hearts of 1300000000 people and establish a full @-@ range and defense system capable of attacks and defence . 
the best and the attack defense . we should strengthen force that could engaged in the ultra @-@ long range to the ultra @-@ long @-@ range , and improve great <unk> development capability and construction of great arms industry in all aerospace . increase the modernization of great military equipment , <unk> and <unk> of military equipment as well as to avoid influence on national economic development , and establish the elite high quality and high @-@ tech equipment .
the battle <unk> sounds about , and people are already fully equipped , and ready to go .
we <unk> nothing without supporting us without supporting us , but we are all powerful by supporting them .
time when we say no other person , i 'd say it 's a time to my fellow citizen . so we have to achieve .
1. the guarantee will be established , improve work and work mechanisms will improve the work and work <unk> and hundreds of it <unk> to united states and around the world recruited back to the china . 
2. creating a few battle groups of the nuclear power carrier .
3 ) 5000 advanced kinds of and combat aircraft for the 5000 kind of aircraft . 
4 ) will be into research and deployed high @-@ speed ballistic missile missiles range of more than 10000 <unk> miles of missile defense systems that could break up a missile defense system . 
5. it 's <unk> nuclear experiments and a military force was established in space .
6. , it is to retain 1000 nuclear bombs as 10000000 tons of nuclear bombs , and that nuclear warheads are installed in all short @-@ range and middle @-@ range missiles . 
7. it is to retain 30 nuclear submarines capable of <unk> 3 devastating nuclear strikes on the enemy . 
<unk> abandoned you 're commitment to first use nuclear weapons .
<unk> retain the right of re @-@ <unk> strike during a threat to national security .
on my fellow citizens , if we 're confident and to improve us , we can strive to be strong . qin shi huang is unification of the china . zheng chenggong has recovered taiwan . we are responsible for our <unk> , so we have to be carried on the <unk> of our <unk> , <unk> , and strong willing to be . 
now , that piece of the land under the land far away from the motherland was shaking , <unk> and call , and were called <unk> citizens - we 'll carry forward a previous general if we are in an <unk> @-@ <unk> wish forward forward .
when i read history in my heart , <unk> and angry at my heart is <unk> to me with a nation . however and common people were born to the motherland and a common person , but i 'm willing to serve for our country , but even if i die , and i 'm <unk> to show my sincere heart , even if i die .
i <unk> the poem <unk> <unk> in a ci (poetry) form of <unk> , <unk> my heart <unk> . 
<unk> the deep red @-@ <unk> .
protect diaoyu islands . 
we lost our ryukyu islands <unk> by <unk> . 
how can we allow diaoyu islands to fall in other countries ? 
100 years of <unk> 
there are <unk> and a <unk> wave of smoke and a <unk> .
the most young brother was still youth .

according to the other article , which is the <unk> of the nation , who is a <unk> who is the <unk> ' <unk> - . " the <unk> , the child , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> 
why do n't we fight the little japan ? 
what does the china still be tolerated ? 
they even riding on our heads .
is this china still doing this ? 
we should tell the whole world " that others can n't be bullied china . 
time when we show our strength , china was too long to be too long . 
currently , our citizens of our citizens are currently too <unk> . the officials are too luxury .
we do n't already have <unk> now , china needs to start war . and the faces are the facing of the countries following the <unk> of united states . 
let they know that us is not <unk> . if we win , it can increase the influence of china . and if we were lost . if we lost , the citizens <unk> will increase . if we were , we can <unk> the <unk> bureaucrats and make the trash getting out up and <unk> the china get up , let 's get a new blood . 
go to china . 
i would suggest that the china will strengthen the <unk> of diaoyu islands , the <unk> of the diaoyu islands , and protect our <unk> and the sovereignty of our country by the military to invade our territory by japan , if the japan dare , we will fight a small @-@ scale war of defend and by the cost of the china . 
we need a show in life but it is really a <unk> to show you by someone .
just , i 'm just about .
this is like the whole society , including the star .
damn , not <unk> .
it is totally unacceptable .
just a cheap <unk> ! their <unk> is somewhat sense at the <unk> of china . 
their life are looking for our life .
the group is a 9 of 9 of the 9 . 
hard for life .
it 's a thing of it 's .
that 's normal . moreover , the the production is always internationally , not the <unk> and not <unk> .
they want money , but they do n't want to face .
look at the wolf in ms. fan near ms. fan . you know the <unk> must have to drink with him , otherwise they 're not forced out or even <unk> . 
the father 's son
as long as to something <unk> , it 's ok .
it 's easy to be : life is like show , meaning you have to look at a movie , to know how to see .

the entertainment circle was dirty . all the men in it will be bird , the <unk> , and the scum .
it 's a pity , but what 's blame ? that is n't that the star for that .
does everybody do this . how can you make money if you do n't do it ?
women were pride in the front of other people , but when they stayed alone , she was a <unk> general .
nowadays , the star is just a popular , a popular person to be a popular person in the ancient time . now they are now a famous person they are now to drink with some high officials , or even sleeping from some high officials , they should just be normal .
stop talking with other people . just behavior .
what should we happen in the future ? there 's not enough enough to success alone ? do we face such hard choices too ?
there are more suffering to the <unk> of the <unk> to be <unk> .
it 's not so bad because they just play out to mind out of their circle ,
however , the old zhang jizhong , the old zhang jizhong in their circle , also think that they are not <unk> <unk> , he had made a tv series when it has nothing to switch for the people of the whole country , he 'll made a tv series . 
both are taking the need .
when can china have a innocents of pure girl ? 
now , in the entertainment world , the story is very shocking , it is rumors that hsu yuki has forced out because the company refused to drink with the company arranged with the family and has to switch to work over the lawyer to make the end of the end to make a meeting . 
the super extensive person often have often encountered social engaged or circumstances , which they are not <unk> but they have to join it .
after all , they cannot decide many things , because they must have to do with many aspects and interests of many people .
sometimes , very normal dinner parties who seem to us are n't that simple for the star , just like we imagine .
the star has a lot of contract , and if they into good <unk> , their source of money is going to <unk> . once if she did n't <unk> good , it 's going to get her <unk> if she did n't <unk> her <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> was 2 kind of kind of <unk> - that kind of people will always hold very high <unk> and would be <unk> rejected all such invited to . 
the second kind of people are good to play the tricks and achieved their objective through their seeds money .
it is rumors that even some <unk> <unk> have won this way 's first role in this way .
after they drink some alcohol or show <unk> , who can have a chance of being lying in the shoulder , <unk> their <unk> , giving their <unk> , or they are the most adopted the attitude of the <unk> female .
they are a very lower 9 <unk> . 
the star of that is just a pretend , and actually live a much better life damn than this .
just a cheap <unk> ! their <unk> is somewhat sense at the <unk> of china . 
( it 's ) is the agreement .
<unk> , the <unk> is n't easy .
they deserve it . they will ask that .
nothing of nothing that is anything to me .
the woman is a `` one " and a man is worse than it 's .

it takes no long .
the route 8 @-@ <unk> " route 8 " which runs around the <unk> <unk> of richmond new urban region was open late in 2004 . 
it 's already going to change development patterns because they make worse and caused a <unk> <unk> around its reports .
richmond times-dispatch told a <unk> of the impact on powhatan county 's huguenot trail . 
will jones reported that traffic in the 1 section of huguenot trail has been <unk> more than the opening of the 8 . 
the speed and accident are <unk> as well .
so far this year , the accident that was reported near the <unk> of winterfield road , up to 12 of the accident in 2004 . 
the residents of virginia department of transportation engineer dale totten noted that if they had more money on the cost , the virginia department of transportation had 4 <unk> on the road for about 13000000 dollars . 
of course vdot did not have money to construct the road in the richmond region . 
because the vdot spent all of their <unk> money due to local politicians and <unk> <unk> . 
where do you need homer simpson when you need him ? 
<unk> , this is a major moment , <unk> .
as we predicted , route 8 will generate the development of electricity , which <unk> the country in a scarce population area all around its reports . 
other people choose to where they work and where they live , but the limited @-@ lived highways can be relief of trafficking as a person who drove back and forth the goochland county and goochland county . 
and they create the <unk> <unk> in the new place .
i am surprised that this is only rapidly .
i 'm even thinking that i could be lagging in 3 years or 4 years . 
think it is the reason that route 8 created all of its <unk> , because it already created 13000000 dollars on a cost of $ 13000000 ( just at this 1 figure ) . 
another prediction .
after a few few years and the approval of <unk> the <unk> commercial projects on 8 is <unk> to need new roads , to be the need of new roads in the intersection of major roads . 
before the end of the decades we can see that the <unk> liability was going to see that the <unk> was going to be <unk> by the original 400000000 billion dollars to be taken by the original highway . 
route 8 is such a great idea <unk> that thinks it . 
thanks for nothing for you .
i think we can spend <unk> <unk> better . 
i think you should n't blame 8 for creating that people . 
what would they be alternative if they were enough to <unk> the new trafficking in the new place ?
additionally , <unk> trafficking in the old place ?
now do you understand what people like the fairfax in fairfax is now . 
i have usually taken a position in favor of the road .
but 8 is definitely worth with a <unk> needed at other of the state . 
richmond has virtually no trafficking . 
the hours of rush lasted 30 minutes . 
and you gave them <unk> through a largely rural area .
the road came to the knife .
just think this money can be spent on another cross @-@ potomac facility or to improve roads , or needed in nova . 
<unk> , <unk> , the rest of the state helped the 8 at last year , so the rest of the state helped it from 8 's budget deal . 
it is very nice that the <unk> is obliged against us .
no sense , but no sense .
the old problem is the same problem .
if you are getting ahead of needs , you 'd be accused of causing <unk> .
if you are built in a place that you are already <unk> needs , then you can n't <unk> your way out <unk>
anonymous , anonymous ( anonymous ) 
that 's fairly point .
 made a good point . 
however , this situation <unk> a valid home report to the home , which found the ctb and vdot to fund transport projects based on its best lobbying , which is based on the comprehensive plan to be based on the state transportation plan . 
i will submit the <unk> situation that should be tolerated .
and chichester , chichester and his sidekick <unk> more money into this flaw and so this is getting worse for this <unk> institutions . 
for instance , what 's the expense of transportation ?
in virginia , it was for the benefit of private business plan , not to serve in the public interests . 
<unk> are <unk> wrong .
not less walter stoch stated that it is intended to pay money for economic development for 8 . 
<unk> , <unk> .
tmt , i do n't understand your point , tmt . 
when did you stick to trafficking whether you 're <unk> to some sort of business or from some sort of business ?
to me , the road is a whole goal to facilitate interest in the public and get from the private business .
although of course , the business support for the sunday , the soccer game , and a soccer game , is <unk> necessary .
it is no wonder that we are suffering the <unk> problems because our roads are increasing the increase of business or domestic state products .
if we recognize that the roads are the primary benefit of business , we should do 2 things . 
of course , businesses are paying more for our transportation bill and we are incentives to locate themselves at least , even if it means more overall travel to stress the system .
why hard so hard to understand it ?
it would be solved for a functioning and <unk> patterns of humans and balance of transportation systems for travel demand for land use .
<unk> with all else .
emr , emr ( emr ) 
tmt said it was in virginia for the benefit of the private business plan , not to serve in the public interests . 
i do n't see this statement 's point , since it appears to <unk> private business plan plan and put public interests above all else .
i think they are <unk> <unk> , so they were virtually the same .
the local problem is obviously that these <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
but if we <unk> business , we will eventually find us to work in <unk> .
i do n't see why to claim the balance of the dynamic ever change , which is going to be solved by the dynamic nature .
you even have seen a <unk> to dulles as well as a job center that promotes <unk> rail demand . 
i agree .
in fact that could be all an sufficient to build it to build it .
all , i say , exactly the same logic should apply to the road ;
as we should have a must use in both end , we should have <unk> our investments .
we need more places to get closer with the balance we say you need .
<unk> , here 's a <unk> .
each , i drove from the past time , and the evening of the morning and the evening . 
i <unk> back on the huguenot trail and forth and forth . 
i have never seen anything <unk> like trafficking <unk>
it 's a <unk> of 55 <unk> where it 's a few @-@ 100 car , how much of what 's the car . 
the <unk> of huguenot trail has already been planned , because the development in the chesterfield side is heavy demand , new schools , and a whole bunch that <unk> in robious road there were 1 years ago . 
8 is wonderful used to us who actually use it but the lack of the road of powhatan and the western chesterfield are <unk> by 8 . 
we may be our commercial development and we can work more close to live .
you can think that does n't be the use of land .
i have no desire to live in any city .
i refuse to work in the downtown area .
i refused to use a mass transit that is n't our <unk> <unk> for a long @-@ term work for regular hours .
and i happened to like the development of a large lot .
i do n't understand exactly how i suppose to keep horses in a 1/4 @-@ mile lot . 
1 gallons of gas could go for 10 dollars . 
and i 'm still paying to live in the country .
many people have legitimate horses , <unk> , <unk> and small type of business , making they want to live in urban core .
i 'm truly <unk> about this <unk> of living in cities .
<unk> anonymous  , if you wish to live in the country , it is every right to live in . 
however , you are not right to <unk> the rest of the state 's construction of a cost of $ 400000000 , which is easier for shops and getting working . 
in the debate of 8 , it is consistently <unk> in the debate of $ 400000000 dollars ( <unk> ) . 
if the money apply to other press , or even <unk> projects , and god forbid , there will be much <unk> to be <unk> .
ray hyde : my comment is direct to the investors who <unk> the road to place the road to near property and the <unk> that would fund this requests without regard to the links between them or lack of co @-@ transportation plan . 
i 'm 24 and my mother is a 2.5 year old . 
i broke up with my father since 8 of 8 . 
i want to start start with other people , and my father said my son had nothing to do with him .
he 's very <unk> and was very <unk> , but because we are together , he has no right for it .
right now , too much going on at his life , and he thought we can work for him , but i told him that i do n't love him and he did n't love me .
i want him there for his son , he does n't need me too .
but he has no one . his family has no get along with him and his family has issues .
i do n't want to be miserable anymore , and if he was around , i am more miserable if he was around .
i do n't want him there for his son , because he was a good father , at least he tried to try .
i believe that every children will need both their parents even than they are together .
but he thinks that no one could have me if he can n't have me .
what do i do , move on my life ?
very bad is the ex @-@ 's threat to you , using your son .
you have to do n't give that , it is just <unk> if you give into .
you are right to live your life and are happy , so because he 's threatened to his threat .
if he really love his son , he saw his son , but this is just a typical control methods used by such as a one .
other people said what i kill me like if you left me if you left me ? it will get you through ?
be an <unk> !
met all the kind of people .
do what you want .
if he <unk> to walk out of your both lives , you will probably be better off you do n't have him .
i agree . the other thing is a other business , not his business to date . 
i do n't tell him .
not because he 's threats does n't , but because he 's not concerned about your personal life .
you can you document his threat ?
you really need .
quit taking to take the call and make him leave the voice <unk> .
make him emailed you , or he <unk> you .

i 'm a lack of sorts , i do n't feel that my lectures is comfortable for me , but i feel i can n't want to give myself off , but i can n't bring a way because i end up with the death ends and aspire to be someone .
i prefer to death with education and does n't live the life i want to live , and i get a matter of <unk> out of uni .
21 've been 21 years and turned into 22 years this year and i do n't have a much time to fail to fail for me , and i have to do something . 
i once failed to college and did another course so i can get into uni over the system and then i want to go through and <unk> .
please can someone some advise with me ?

focus on what you 're in life . you do n't state your studies or indeed , so if you want your experience ? because your mum wants to get a degree ? because your mum wants to go for the career you want to go for ?
either way , you <unk> up why you 're over there and work off your bottom to get something that you can say , as you get your degree and i 'm not working as well as you are hard to work and pass and pass .

i walked on my <unk> but i was born with a strange <unk> with <unk> <unk> with the surgery 2 years ago . 
my brother was <unk> but i did n't notice if it was , but it 's probably so it was the the one , but i 'm probably to have a <unk> asperger's , so i 've had a problem with a society problem and i did n't picked up with a society reaction @/@ body language there . 
but then i do n't have a proper <unk> and you even have some of symptoms , that you can n't even have certain conditions .
1 've been told for 1 <unk> , so i 'm not <unk> on my <unk> , so i 'm not going to walk on my <unk> .

but i love loads of my best mate , and he means the world , and if i do anything he did .
i do n't tell him , but he found out .
i do n't want to hurt him . i do n't want to hurt him .
what do i do ?
thanks for reading .
you on any drugs or they get any therapy .
you should be talking about your schools and your general <unk> , and tell what to go on .
you can be able to tell school teacher you can tell .
if you tell them , you can help you .
if you keep it inside , it likely is only gonna get worse .
in me , i was better . these things are the best getting this earlier than so let it even get worse .
please do n't do this .
17 've been 17 years and i 'll start self harm last year , but i stop my arms for my arms , only a few months ago . 
it 's hard , but you can do it .
i feel so much harder , but to see what i 've felt <unk> and how strong i 'm so strong of me so i want to do such to me .
also , strength , you can do it . i find <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and keep the <unk> .
self is a self harm , but you can overcome it .
remember , it 's not a self harm that you 're people .
you can overcome it .
so , in the past year , i think i was getting a form of ocd , i find it will always check what i belong to me every year , to ensure that i go out of uni and not to leave anything not . 
i often have to check myself twice every year and then after some seconds , then after some reason i can n't resist to check again . 
<unk> why ?
am i crazy , or something ?
it is most often when it carrying many things , but it is going to carry many , even every day , not even 1 , will it be the ocd to any extent ? 
what can i can do with this ?
if i do n't checked , i would get very <unk> just sort of going away after 15 minutes , but it 's often much anxiety , so i can n't be able to wait that long . 
i feel if if i lost my <unk> or phone , i feel <unk> .
i just wish to be able to go out without leaving something 2 - i 'm not worried about or lost it . 
i do n't really know what to do and i 'm afraid of going to the general <unk>
they will probably never hear some compulsion like this and i just do n't know what to do .
any of you have a similar ritual ?
people think i 'm crazy but that you are very strange difficult to get you out of this .
how can you advise me ?
i used to do this in my way to college . has a list of items i know i have and i 'm used to check off on the bus .
i now have more anxiety and i think this is a warning sign , so i 'm just trying to try on the habit of <unk> a relative <unk> , and definitely visit a doctor easier than doing , but also tell you not to keep checking this thing .
do n't worry that the doctor saw a much worse cases because of a doctor saw that .
i have done on ocd <unk> today , <unk> <unk> class . 
maybe it is just a way to get rid of <unk> ' <unk> just , so not check a loss of something and just leave it .
however , your anxiety levels has gradually decreased decreasing , so that your ocd <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
that 's just sounds like you 're over , rather than having really bad ocd . 
i 'm very obsessed out of the <unk> 1 night , to check out all of my house in my house in particular . 
i sometimes convinced them but i know they are going to lock , but i know them .
i think it 's becoming a real problem , it 's going to become a real problem , 1 <unk> your year . 
you 're definitely not crazy about yourself , and i 'm sure your general <unk> will understand the issue .
i went to the therapy for no other reason , and they encourage me to pick , stick to the number of the number of the 20 and cut down , and cut myself .
i think my teacher is a idea and i 'm still ok if i checked at 5 or check 20 .
so far i am a lot more , i think it 's definitely hope for anyone who want to improve .
i 'm pretty pretty calm about things , like i like to take it as it comes , and i 'm not too much worried .
but in the past 1 @-@ 2 months , i find me to become real <unk> on things , and i do n't talk about it was merely the real feel that it was <unk> . 
i begin to feel that a variety of things that i 'm not too much to worry about my mind , which is even not too much to worry about my mind as something at something that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my head .
i 'm not sure this is because it is changing the " time " or a sign of other issues ( or go into a unemployment free ) , or i 'm beginning to me because it has any confidence and happy , i am beginning to me if it has any confidence and happy .
i speak it to a few people including my parents , but all of people all think i 'd go for my acts and , until a serious problem is clear .
so , what 's the best thing to do ?
you speak to it on a doctor and see the anti @-@ anxiety pills off the edges from things could take off ?
do i see that i can speak to a <unk> ?
or should i take the advice that close people around me and just i 'm just eye in anxiety until anxiety has become problems ?
well , i should not start trying to try your anxiety , because it makes me to make a anxiety and more likely to be more panic .
i recommend trying to focus on something as soon as you start to feel anything a bit of <unk> , making you feel <unk> or feel more happy .
if you can n't do that , if you start your friends to feel your panic , you will get one of your laugh . lol , it works to me , and i suffer a page attack of your friends .
it 's starting that it 's just as severe as much as you sounds as things are really really worried about a tiny things .
i find it 's help just talking about someone else who made you <unk> .
i find my mum to mention what to me and see them to react to the situation in a way that i should react to be a big way to be a big deal , but i know not a <unk> way , but i know i 'm not a <unk> way .
but if it 's getting worse , go to the doctor .
i have a friend , who suffered severe anxiety that they can prevent leaving the house and do things so worry about what they can go wrong .
the doctor gave her and she made her that she makes her a much better .
