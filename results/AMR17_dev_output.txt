many that makes sense the urgency when they watch things <unk> as a <unk> , you 're a <unk> dragon , you 're <unk> a <unk> tiger , i admire a <unk> mind !
history gives us too many lessons ( <unk> and <unk> ) ?
looking for ...
the ordinary people are suffering , salt fish was still <unk> even if their body turned over .
with speaking of speech @/@ thinking of traditional views and slightly different criticism , if people expressed their own different views , they are called foreign slaves or were accused of revere and fascinating of foreign things .
more considered the culture of the china they are considered the traitors of china , which is <unk> in nationalism and patriotism . 
in fact , us no longer needs to use force to deal with china , because it achieved a result in defeat their enemy soldiers without fighting . 
is it too intense ? the article is so good ? 
do n't assume things exist if your eyes do n't see things and your ears is n't going to hear about it . 3 people create a tiger . 
just past and looking for my opinion , i do n't express my opinions .
coming for studies and learning .
very attraction .
it should have been <unk> advocate .
some people do n't forget to be china . if the country needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness 
especially i really hate those who drink china and say that america is so whatever but and and if america is so good if the america was so good , go find an illegitimate father . 
i feel our people should learn more from dprk and the socialism 's <unk> needs to be held , but can n't forget mao zedong 's thinking . 
only mao zedong thought could save the nation . 
there are too many traitors of china traitors . 
patriotism is the bottom line . everyone must prove they deserve a nation .
i think it 's not that elite , but some of the corrupt officials are bribes .
remove this <unk> group :
i 'm just looking .
we need a <unk> for so many traitors of people in the history of china . 
since the chaos in east africa and north africa , we also have to prevent the residents who are the traitors who ran up from a <unk> of west imperialist . 
everything has their set number . it 's not time when the weather changes in china . the traitors could only do mad like dogs . perhaps nothing else , they can only be disappointed . 
people came from all a direction to the china court back before there is no long . the world is led . heaven has intended for heaven . 
following interest .
the modern china just specialized on this and there is nothing we can do . 
among our compatriots , there are too many traitors of <unk> .
freedom of speech relatively free . we need to account for national condition .
speak @/@ thinking is free . if people express the views that traditional views are somewhat different and put slightly different criticism , they are called foreign slaves or were accused of revere and fascinating of foreign things .
i would like to ask people who say this as those mentioned above those who are mentioned above .
we are welcome to the military affairs of military affairs that you want to become a soldier , but the quality of military clothing , but you have no success for a group of a group have a <unk> group . people who are not successful for groups must adhere to the system in terms of the group . the people must adhere to the same . and this group is only permitted to enter their group card card to be consistent with other people 's format , we ask you voluntarily leave , if we do n't conform you , we do n't follow the system of them . 
support ; bump .
at critical moments , we all <unk> from the emperor yan and huang . 
look at kuomintang 's cooperation with communist in that year and you know . 
a criminal creation in a peaceful year does not influence an cooperation with everybody during war .
it might compete with the cultural revolution article by <unk> a cultural revolution by <unk> problems in order to become the question of principle or ideological ideology lines . 
by the 5 th column , people have a vested interest in communist party . 
first of all , if you want to destroy the people , language and written culture is their national culture . all everyone that goes to next grade or everyone entering the higher school is currently tested on english . 
turn .
you 're a <unk> dragon , a <unk> tiger , it makes sense . wait for opportunities !
in fact , us has no longer need to use force to deal with china because it has reached results in defeat its enemy without fighting . 
yes . there are many foreign slaves . it 's time where we should be <unk> .
the ruling authorities actually should attend this kind of <unk> , deng xiaoping said the communist party would not be overthrown and if they fall , the former ambassador of the communist party ( <unk> ) deng xiaoping would have been overthrown . once in a speech in us , the cia said that we raise 800000 <unk> in the china , and then the cia is going to bring up 1 - 8000000 yuan , and they definitely need to be alert on this , and they are definitely needed to help us to allow them to raise the wind , and let outsiders use us . 
the reason why i would say that the experts had been seeing from the past several days , and i saw wang jingwei 's <unk> at <unk> . 
the west society allows these people to see the dawn of democracy being fair and justice . 
because of the fact that political development of a bit advanced ideology are too slow to critical of those with a bit advanced ideology . can we be able to blame others for this ?
is n't it going to say someone 's bribe ?
all people are selfish , and reality is also often gray .
some zf propaganda activities will soon become people view in the joke . 
in this environment , what 's wrong in this environment that they have a bit criticism of previous <unk> propaganda ?
we can n't look at the old account for the previous so called war on japan . 
look at north korea like our country many years ago , look at their ridiculous propaganda . 
united states has never stopped a dream to occupy the whole world and was constantly planning . 
it 's a kind of more and more intense feelings this day . in the long bribe of the china intellectual elite , america has already successful a 5 th column set up . 
these people can consider themselves as a cultural celebrity , or they can have high authorities and important positions in various circles and will take great pain to promote america values and brainwash the china people on behalf of the people . 
why is this kind of feeling to intensify and more ?
this day i read the part of specialist professor these . it 's ok that i have n't read it , but it was really surprised me after . 
zhang ming , assistant professor for renmin university , for example , the political intent of many of his blog is extremely obvious . 
for example , in 1 blog , he attributed to the <unk> of elementary school <unk> to have wang erxiao in china , and has <unk> good articles that promote patriotism and not worth even pennies . 
another example of " so called " li yinhe social activists ( li yinhe ) . 1 . her stuff is not like things such as haite sexology report , she did n't think in deep . ( 3 ) she has no significant contribution . 
she 's mainly relying on whether she is attracted to people 's eyes , not really able to do something different or shocking <unk> , not the fact that she is really capable or learn . she 's pure clown .
this kind of people put on a big specialists so just to intimidate people . key she does n't understand politics , but she has yet to be a <unk> and a <unk> , but she was willing to slaves and be a ignorant , but she has felt fine , but she has felt fine .
for example , she completely came out of class struggle and a bit of a bit less hostilities in a <unk> title of a bit of hostilities and a bit more politicians to be on social hostilities .
she attributed the money worship of the china society in a " <unk> " in the title that japan already became most of the money worship countries than earth . 
she <unk> in the title of the title that your students have been becoming terrorists in the title of whether you study paul or bill ? 
in the title of the title that the constitutional court should be established in order to solve the way of porn products , she took citizens published on the freedom of speech , and said that the beijing drive to solve the problems of pornography is not a constitutional behavior . 
once , in spite of today , in the case of today , she <unk> cry of several beijing city dealer , and details of such a close attention to the jianghe business activities was involved in the state business activity , and why were such a close attention of the local product of jianghe , which is a deeper intent for being publicized for others . 
but the real preposterous thing is that sina actually put this kind of <unk> articles in top . 
america is also engaged in its containing china and the whole nation are also engaged in the way of the china , and when the whole nation feel <unk> , and the <unk> of the whole shichuan actually came out of its <unk> <unk> with its own <unk> <unk> with their people without fear . 
yi zhongtian , which i always respect for his <unk> in 3 countries and his learned , but i do n't expect yi zhongtian to actually support mao yushi , but i do n't expect him to actually support him by saying that any of his <unk> would have made my glasses very much , once again , that makes me drop very much . 
regarding the complete note on 100 china celebrities in china , i also feel that a increasing <unk> in the internet is a increasingly <unk> , and a segment of intellectual elite in the country , which has become a traitor , and has already become willful and not afraid of the country . 
however , when these people are frequently remarks on the traitor , i do n't understand why no one is <unk> and <unk> by no one . moreover , they can continue high position when they call the wind and <unk> the rain in <unk> and public opinion .
i feel the part of an intellectual elite newspaper could sink with the media personality for a short while of the short while ago , i feel to sink with the media personality .
i remember us had just war more than 60 years ago and china still threatened to use nuclear weapons . 
us entered vietnam more than 40 years ago to contain china . 
it has established a relationship with china 22 years ago , but 22 years ago , it started to impose the sanctions on china 22 years ago , bombing the embassy 12 years ago and 10 years ago with south china sea 10 years ago , moving it up in a greater <unk> 2 years ago . 
i do n't understand why we are so forget ? 
why is there still so many people who are speaking on us ignore their conscience ? 
people do n't improve their ability to remember without big lose . we china are the greatest weak of this . 
so , the forces of the traitors of china will also stand to the reason , and to run the 5 th column rampant . 
it 's entirely possible - do we not raise one of the primary school students traitors of china ? 
it 's entirely possible - do we not raise one of the primary school students traitors of china ?

a capitalist that has always been along with any so so called this victory would use this so called " victory " to justify that any regulation , or calling it <unk> .

what do you think of capitalism and activity ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> an oligarchy , setanta . 
the government regulation is good for the evolution of capitalism .
if health horror and safety horror need regulation , the industry will ever do what is right for humanity .
setanta , i have no problem with capitalism , but i have a problem with <unk> capitalism . 
i completely agree with this .
capitalism is thriving when everyone understands , play by the rule and enforce them .
if trouble really begin , everyone must spend all their time to try to particularly rule , trying to understand the rules or fight people who do n't follow them .
that is the deregulation of the deregulation problem .
the ruling was removed ( which means businesses must be race to counter new business that started on the new business ) , does n't help them more competition .
it would be like change the monopoly rule in half the game so the previous previous purchase does n't mean all the previous purchase . 
that does n't benefit capitalism , though some would tell you .
i only agree with arab who <unk> the bomb out of all the example . 
that may be extremely rude , but that is extremely rude .
the actual part of that kind should have no place in college .
however , these kids list the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , and a few other things that they deem to be insensitive in the race .
is n't the race insensitive ?
are they not in mexico ? 
that 's a huge part of being dressed away from the city you get away from the city .
how would that insult ?
it does n't show someone who does something of a derogatory , but using society 's own clothes in the reality .
<unk> is not insensitive too .
again , this is the only opinion this takes it way over the board .
sometimes people seem to look at the reason for being offended
frankly , it is about perspective .
someone will always see something , and want to think it was the worst .
not that is going to change that , or not with the actual .
and why are n't the only insensitive race @/@ culture that is n't only that racial @/@ culture ?
is n't it just equal to add a tear <unk> , <unk> your tooth <unk> , and white <unk> , and white <unk> , right ?
what about women who wear <unk> , high <unk> and will too much make up for <unk> ?
this drove to find something insensitive may be stopped .
and if someone wants to look like why they have been held back because they have in their head , they always will always find justification ?
but , why do we really jump on the board of free social <unk> behavior , why would we really jump on the board ?
so now why is it ok to find the best offensive and throw out new discrimination on it ?
and , why is this ruling only applies to 2 or 3 races ?
america , whites , blacks , green people , short people , tall people and fat people . 
what do you have , when it comes to an actual way , is it going to make all fun in some way , but only those 3 race get the red light ? 
is n't that racist , is n't it ?
students <unk> <unk> , and <unk> enough to realize that one should be able to be able to be able to be able to be aware of both and cultural <unk> <unk> , and this is not evil mechanism of racism .
this is a absolute ridiculous thread .
i mean the actual " racism " is actually banned if you can all have a point .
i 'm for the ' white ' us ' plight , as anyone is used about it . 
but anyone else read the article ?
no one is going to ban the halloween halloween . 
no one is even talking about the banning of halloween <unk> . 
in fact no one in this story want to ban anything other than people on here who apparently want to ban the poster .
these students have a simple goal .
they said we could change a few people , if we can make them a think , or it 's awesome .
they do n't ban anything or stop anybody from doing anything .
this story is about the students expressed free speech .
they made the poster who expresses their opinions .
of course , you want to wear an expert that other people found , if there is free speech .
but there is also a free speech that i 'm complaining that your actual in your ignorance is offensive .
neither should be banned .
and that is the way it works .
it is irrelevant whether there is black face and <unk> , or <unk> you in an <unk> in a <unk> sandwich that i think it was a little too <unk> , which i think .
freedom speech is free speech and the <unk> of that is actually the opposite of the alleged ban .
this story turned this story at the end of it .
so , so , would she have any chance of <unk> a republican party senator named scott brown ? 
why is scott brown necessary to be <unk> . i kinda like him ? 
could elizabeth warren beat scott brown ? 
i 've never seen a girl 's fighting is the most brutal fight , but i 'm not sure a lot of kicking kicking and scratch , some amazing <unk> has to stay at home for almost 1 weeks until the <unk> went down into schools until it goes down . 
so i say yes .
i think democratic party got 1 more senate seats . 
it seems to be a lot of <unk> easier in massachusetts than other senate race . 
i think it is best thing to keep a few moderate moderate we have from the right where we have . 
he is reasonable to come most of the liberal leaning constituency , but he can vote for most things along the party lines .
not unknown , it sounds like a real <unk> contest , does n't it ?
it makes it some really great contest off the year .
care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?
he was beating martha coakley with a rather convincing . 
he has been senator for the state for several years . 
he even voted for several democratic party bills . 
coakley is a bad candidate running a terrible campaign around , i hunt a great article reading 1 years ago <unk> on his tremendous mistakes . 
it 's difficult for brown to answer his question of policy . 
from several occasions , i see he 's answer , including several really embarrassed answers , shows that he really does n't understand the underlying issues at all .
i 'm really not being active or even care of political until recently , and i 'm just looking at what other people 's opinions on this .
well , yeah , just being telling you my vote for the people i would probably have no <unk> at you , is n't you ?
what issues are important for you ?
obama , i think he did a good job to most areas , he let me let me down in some areas , and today is no way i voted for the republican party today . 
i 've done at the past local times in the past .
anyone is not in republican party . 
i think there are a majority of them why this country has become <unk> in everything important .
they are willing to throw america under the bus to make obama look bad . 
ok , why the reason and why add a lot . you 're right .
i voted for obama because i think he did good job in the difficult circumstances , and can do much more in another terms , and i really worry about what any republican party can do as a president if 1 of them won . 
i have heard of some good things about ron paul , but i also do n't vote for any good things ( especially rick perry ) . he is only a republican party who actually learned that i 'm actually interested . 
my opinion is that i am happy to race and especially a debate , ron paul . 
i like how he is against the war and anti @-@ bs .
however , i absolutely do n't want him to be president .
andrew sullivan has a lot of posts about him , if you are interested in learning more , maybe a good place where you start . 
he <unk> ron paul here , he endorsed him and then the second thought . 
today , i read a piece that i am fascinating today . 
the author speaks of how much of obama 's approval ratings are dismal low . 
apparently he can n't pull the congress to accomplish much together and the author of the author would only get worse if he gets elected for the second term . 
he would like that obama <unk> the second term , and hillary clinton ran the president . 
he believed that hillary was the best chance of bringing the country together . 
i do n't know what she feels , but i think it 's a great idea , but i think it is .
she certainly has <unk> and experience and she was approved by a majority of citizens .
i think people on the republican party side of the fence are poor bunch . 
there is no one one of the people who captured the <unk> of the america . 
in my opinion , a moderate person and independents is voters who decide this election . they certainly do n't vote for any pro @-@ life anti @-@ life <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
what do you think ?
should obama step down for the good of the country ? 
should hillary run ? 
hillary 's time came and went . 
she is not friends with the democratic party by being divided and lost black people vote . 
no one who does n't vote for mr. obama voted for her , and a whole lot less voters voted for her . 
do n't worry , though .
she made sense enough that she is not trying to run to the sitting president of her party .
the best case is that obama is re @-@ election and the country will continue to slide backwards , even if the democratic party gain the us senate 's greater foothold and increasing their collective mass in the congress . 
in the worst case the election of george w. bush ii ( or any republican party candidate ) is a scenario , who does n't mean huntsman , romney or ron paul . 
that means that the republican party are likely to gain further through the congress , perhaps even gain by the senate by the senate . 
then the country <unk> right back into its deepest recession .
i suspect , you are wrong with the moderate people to vote for their vote and especially the one you call the tea bags so inclined to vote .
i can actually think you are wrong , but i think you 're wrong about the <unk> voters @/@ independent voters too .
i expect to turn out fairly good , that group of those groups opposed obama . 
i can accept hillary . 
i 'm not a great impressed by the republican party field like phoenix was n't . 
the presumed candidate of democratic party is n't crazy , either . 
but obama seems to be even less likely to <unk> than cain gave up . 
i guess , i am not a summary optimistic about the future of the country for the next 5 years . 
<a <unk> for ny - they are aware that it 's just about the party line , it 's not a vote on the party , but it 's a vote for the right . 
jcboy , have they actually voted for gay marriage yet jcboy ? 
i got a mixed message out of ny times . 
sure , they 're doing , tsarstepan . 
hopefully other states are aware that gay marriage hurts nobody .
look at massachusetts . they have it since 2004 . 
do you hear their society fall apart ? no , of course not ?
i think it is rapidly spread across the country with ny and then ca . 
you can n't stop this training .
jcboy , i hope the congress address this issue soon , and just <unk> the whole state of state by making national laws from same marriage marriage . 
you 're correct , jcboy . 
another matters is that one 's home state has recognized the same marriage in the state out of states .
when i study ny 's domestic relations law , i think the government permission to be married for a citizen is damned dignity . 
david said that citizens create their own damn government . 
do you guys hear that the plane crashed in the helicopter ?
i have no idea how that happened .
what do you think ?
that 's a <unk> <unk> and the control of air trafficking will not aid you when you fly under . 
there is an accident but this particular area can need additional regulation such as a minimum <unk> helicopter .
my husband and kids and my kids have spent 1 days out at the <unk> with another couple and their kids who were long friends . 
at some point we came across a huge tree of falling trees , friends , l. , and started to walk up . 
the 11 @-@ year @-@ old son was followed by l. , but he was suddenly aware that they and her can n't get down that easy . 
he asked our son back and get back away from her to give him a room to get him down too .
our son did n't get out of his way when he did n't get out of his way .
he has fun , we had to tell him twice more , and then obedient .
after that , l. gets back down , he suddenly grab our son from behind and threw him all his <unk> at the ground and <unk> him all . 
we are <unk> .
a 215 year old man could have easily injured him . 
unfortunately he 's very frightening , unfortunately he 's got up without <unk> .
we were deeply shocked because we never hit our children .
does anybody know what the legal way to teach men is to teach a man ?
so to file the police report ?
if someone is a friend , i personally deal with the situation with a level of people to people .
why can n't you make sure you really upset and do n't want them ever to hit your kids again ?
2 <unk> law . 
money damage , and the time of jail .
i suppose you might add probation , but it 's just being replaced at jail times .
if you go through legal routes , it is pretty much to end friendship , regardless of what .
if i was angry enough that i start down this path i 'd not worry where it ended up .
i probably expressed what i feel like the situation and make it clear that it 's not going again .
your son was in the assault .
that is the ability of your ex @-@ friends ' behavior .
he physically does n't hurt your children , so the assault was less of the less form of assault , the assault was seen more seriously .
you certainly can file the police report .
i do n't know what the laws are in where you are , but here is quite likely to go around , question the man and make you to file the charge , but you can decide clear that if your descriptions is accurate , you 're quite likely .
again , depending on where you live , you are likely to notify the child protection authority .
they simply handed it to the police here because it 's an extra <unk> and you already decided that you are not exposed to him again with him again .
yet you release the legal <unk> to the bottle if you lost control what a <unk> did .
for example , you and your son need a formal statement .
the police can act even if you do n't want to .
maybe it went into court .
personally , i do n't choose to do it in that way to do with local police without name the name , but if you can certainly see whether or is such things like your area or have a formal caution in your area .
i hope you 're a big message to talk about you and the loss of friendship .
however , i am concerned about how he treated his kids .
that 's the hell of one over .
if you have the evidence that he was assault on his kids , i consider the child protection of children .
okay , are your kids ?
that 's scary .
did he have a nightmare or anything ?
also , i 'm with his behavior with him .
it 's not an such reaction , he does n't think .
if your friends are really unusual behavior , then i 'm frankly worried about her too bit too .
i 'm a 25 @-@ year @-@ old woman and had a relationship with a 37 year old man for 2 years . 
he has 2 kids , including 1 kids from his marriage , and 1 kids from his previous relationship . 
since the first day we met , he planned to divorce .
things are so heat between us and i do n't know what to do .
he planned to move out of the house by the end , because he and his wife did n't see eye to eye .
he chat with sex from sweden who he met in facebook . 
when it found out , it really makes me really a bad effect .
i felt to be a traitor , still feel it , and i can n't trust him .
how do i let go ?
just walking away jeje . 
do you really think about yourself so little , so believe that this is best to do ?
if it 's just going ahead and now it 's just going to love you in divorce or at least move out of a man 's house .
as a man who was involved in the other sex chat with your relationship , he has a relationship with you .
personally , when you mess with a married man , you personally deserve what you get .
i have a little pity you did n't .
but you can do a good world just to walk away from him .
then why do n't you think you look at someone who does n't ?
to me , if you go that route , it is a bit better to likely find happiness .
